4 Vocabulary
4.1 General
This file contains characters that are single-byte, double-word, or four-byte encoded.
The single-byte portion includes all 128 characters in GB/T 11383-1989, from 0x00 to 0x7F.
4.3 Double-byte part
All of the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, CJK unified Chinese characters, and portions of the graphic characters in GB/T 13000 are included in the double-byte component.
In Appendix A, the characters in the double-byte section are listed.
Among these, the Appendix B requirements must be followed for the graphics, code places, and functions of ideographic descriptors.
Note: The standard Chinese character encoding used in China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and other nations and regions is called GB/T 13000.
Chinese characters with distinctive abstract glyphs are given their own code positions, while characters with the same abstract glyph but from various sources are given a similar code position.
CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea, and the encoded Chinese characters are referred to as CJK unified Chinese characters or CCJK Unified Ideographs.
4.4 Four-byte part
The text lists various Chinese characters in different standards, including GB/T 13000, .CJK unified character extensions A and C/D, and expansions.
The characters in the four-byte section adhere to Appendix C's rules.
5 Overall structure
The text uses hexadecimal notation for integers marked with a 0x, whereas decimal notation is used for values without a 0x.
The appendix's codes are all expressed in hexadecimal, while decimal is used for all other values.
The single-byte portion uses the GB/T 11383-1989 encoding scheme and the code points 0x00–0x7F.
1st byte: 0x81-0xFE, last byte: 0x40-0x7E, 0x80-0xFE double-word component uses two 8-bit binary strings for each letter.
The coding range for the four-byte component is 0x81308130-0xFE39FE39, while the suffix used to expand the double-byte code is 0x30-0x39, which was not utilized in GB/Work 11383-1989.
The first character of a four-byte character has an encoding range of 0x81-0xFE; the second character's range is 0x30-0x39; the third byte's range is 0x81-0xFE; and the fourth character's range is 0x30 A 0x39. Right now: 0x81308130-0x81308139; 0x81308230-0x81308239 0x8130FEFE30-0x8130FE39; 0x81318130-0x81318139; Oo2douolag0c "0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30-0xFE39FE39.

This man page's substance, which is confined to characterizing the alternatives, is extricated from the GNU C Compiler's comprehensive documentation.
The EURo record and the Information record are definitive unless it is effectively kept up.
Check the Data area in the event that you find a contrast between the man page and the program
We'll halt posting this manual page in case we find that the data on it is out of date and clearly causing issues and complaints, further maintenance work on Gnu cc isn't cleared out to the client, subsequently, there are no other options, such as updating the Information record and the man manual. There's time for this. The GNU Extend accepts that man pages are out of date which time would be way better went through somewhere else.

Depiction (Portrayal) (Portrayal) Compilers for C and C++ are combined. Both of them perform one or more of the taking after four forms when handling input records: preprocessing (preprocessing), Hii (compilation), (get together), and Insignificant (connecting).
The source record addition demonstrates the dialect of the source record, but it moreover decides the compiler's default arrangement:
The preprocessed record (.i) is treated as a c record by gcc, who too sets the link's organize to c，
g++ considers the preprocessed record (.i) to be a c++ record, and sets the interface in c++ shape.
The dialect sort and ensuing operations are shown by the post-level title of the source record:
.C source code that does preprocessing, compilation, and gathering
.C++ source code for preprocessing, compilation, and gathering
.C++ source code for preprocessing, compilation, and get together

Within the nonattendance of the -cec, -s, or -E choices, connecting is continuously the final step (or compilation blunders avoid the total prepare).
All source program.e records, -1 library records, and obscure record names (counting specified.o H standard records and.a library records) are conveyed to the linker within the association stage within the arrange indicated by the command line alternatives (Choices)
Parameters must be indicated separately since "de" and "-d -r" are totally diverse.
The larger part of "-=E:" and "-W" choices have two polar alternate extremes: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Here, as it were designs that are not among the standard choices are recorded.
All of the alternatives are recorded here, organized by kind, with clarifications taking after.
Choice for Code Era
In general Choice
Demonstrate clearly that dialect is the dialect of any extra input records (rather than the default choice from the conclusion of the filename).
This alternative is appropriate to all input records after that up until the following "-x" choice. dialect not required
To guarantee that taking after records are handled in agreement with the record title RE AS E "-x" choice, cripple any express dialect determination.
You'll be able utilize the "-x" choice (or Ok taking after the record title) to tell Geo where to begin in the event that you fair work a parcel of the four phases (preprocessing, compilation, get together, and connecting). You'll utilize the “-c,” “-s,” or the “-E” alternative to tell Geo where to end, be mindful that a few choices, such “-x cpp-output -E,” cause MEF to break even with 0, ETER, compile or put together source records. ATI Period GCC substitutes the source record title by default with ".o" and ".ec." The -o alternative permits the choice of extra names, after the -ec alternative, GCC overlooks any unrecognized input content. -S F anything.
The target record.
Stops after compilation and does not perform get together.
Since the constructing agents on those frameworks cannot examined from channels, utilize channels instead of brief records to move between the different compilation stages, this issue does not exist within the GNU constructing agent, constructing agents can utilize C "lingos" that bolster ANSI-compliant standard C programs.
This would impair ANSI trigraph highlights like unix and vax, which are stamped as welcome but occasionally utilized, as well as those that are utilized indeed in case they are not welcome and a few include watchwords in GNU Cc that are contradictory with ANSI Cc, all standard libraries have get to to (Explanation: Facilitated environment (facilitated environment)), and the most work returns an int esteem, the endless larger part of programs, barring the part, serve as an illustration, there's no standard library within the related free environment (unsupported environment), and the program section require not always be fundamental. Most The kernel of the working framework is the foremost self-evident case, see the foremost later data on the gcc site for more data.
Treat work statements that do not have parameters, like "int foo ();," within the C way, which implies you shouldn't indicate the number or kind of parameters. (C++ as it were) .
In C++, a function like foo often indicates that the argument is empty.
Here, segment postings have been trimmed in an exertion to suit a few highlights of customary C compilers.
Subtle elements can be found within the NU c handbook; we evacuated them so that perusers wouldn't HERI when the data was not pertinent.
With one exception: the “-traditional” option has the unintended side effect of enabling assignment to this for C++ applications (but not C).
It has the same impact as the "-Ethis-is-variable" alternative.
-traditional-cpp bolsters a number of highlights of the customary Cc preprocessor.
Especially, the preprocessor demonstrated over, but not the other results of the "-conventional" alternative.
-fdollars-in-identifiers “$” characters are allowed in identifiers (as it were in C++).
The "-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers" alternative can be utilized to particularly cripple the "$" character.
(On a few target frameworks, GNU C++ licenses the “$” character by default, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv (MEF C++) Allow verifiable change of subterranean insect sorts to identification sorts.
Enum to int change is ordinarily allowed in GNU C++, but not the other way around.
-fexternal—templates Decrease the estimate of format affirmations (as it were in C++) by replicating each layout work as it were where it is characterized.
For this choice to work, all template-using records must be checked with "#pragma implementatio" (definition) or "#Pragma interface" (announcement).
Format instantiations are all outside sorts when a program is compiled with the alternative "-fexternal-templates". The execution file's essential occurrences must be made to seem.
With typedefs, which make reference to each required occasion, this is often conceivable.
Hence, all format occasions are expressly indicated as built-ins when compiling with the default "-fno-exteznal-templates" choice.
All part capacities are dealt with as virtual capacities of the encasing lesson, with the exemption of constructor capacities and the mnew and erase part administrators.
Not each call to a part work will essentially go through the inside vtable as a result of this.
A virtual work may once in a while be able to be called specifically in case the compiler decides it can; in this case, it'll be.
-fcond-mismatch Acknowledge a sort jumble between the condition expression's moment and third contentions.
Such an expression incorporates a esteem of Void. Task to typically permitted (as it were in C++) utilizing the hail -fthis—is-variable.
Assignable "this" got to be out of date when user-defined free capacity administration was included to C++.
Task to this interior a course part work is in this way by default a lawful operation.
With the “-fthis-is-variable” choice, you'll permit this in spite of the fact that for in reverse compatibility.
-funsigned-char Characterize char as a sort that's unsigned, comparable to unsigned char.
Each machine features a one of a kind default char sort. It may well be either marked or unsigned char.
When depending on the signedness of the information, a convenient program ought to continuously utilize marked char or unsigned chaz.
However, a part of apps as it were back plain char and anticipate this to be marked (or unsigned, depending on the machine the program is composed for).
This choice and its inverse constrain the identical default behavior for that program.
Indeed in spite of the fact that a char carries on absolutely like one of them, its sort ought to continuously be explicitly expressed as either a marked char or an unsigned char.
These alternatives are utilized to characterize marked or unsigned bitfields in case no “signed” or “unsigned” modifiers are explicitly given.
In spite of the fact that the basic numbers sorts they infer from, like int, are marked, bitfields are marked by default; be that as it may, in the event that the “-traditional” alternative is provided, bitfields are continuously unsigned.
String constants are not given uncommon treatment by -fwritable-strings; instep, they are put away within the writable information fragment.
Typically done to guarantee compatibility with more seasoned applications that do not think it's a great thought to alter string constants, the same result is accomplished utilizing the “-traditional” choice.
Official blend
COVID-19's impacts on the pharmaceutical showcase
The impacts can be comparable to the monetary emergency of 2008
The globe is right now encountering an unparalleled emergency as a result of the COVID-19 scourge.
The affliction has disabled wellbeing frameworks in a few countries to the point of collapse, and government confinements have seriously disturbed the world economy.
The outbreak's impacts on the pharma industry are vague and difficult to estimate, but they may be critical.
Due to the constrained get to to antecedents and essential chemicals caused by development confinements, certain makers may be obliged to create modern strategies of medicine generation.
Due to travel limitations, traffickers may got to discover elective courses and methods to cross nations.
Governments' capacity to respond may be blocked on the off chance that sedate utilize and accessibility designs move.
In spite of the fact that the COVID-19 move is bizarre, there are a few lessons to be learned from other emergencies.
A few sedate clients begun searching for less costly manufactured drugs amid the 2008 budgetary emergency, and their drug-using propensities changed to sedate infusion.
Governments have moreover diminished financing for drug-related programs.
Intercessions like medicate utilize and related hazard behavior anticipation and medicate treatment programs may be extremely hurt in the event that governments reacted to the show retreat within the same way.
Additionally, interdiction endeavors and universal collaboration may get less consideration, which would make it easier for traffickers to conduct their commerce.
Nations where noteworthy sums of opiates are snuck on commercial flights are expected to be most extremely affected.
Some of the time in colossal amounts, dispatches transport engineered drugs like methamphetamine in masked carry-on packs or rucksacks. Since that limits on discuss traveler activity are being actualized essentially all over, the utilize of commercial flying for the transportation of drugs can be totally hampered.
Regardless the disturbance of worldwide postal supply lines, there may be an upsurge within the trafficking of things by means of the mail and the dull web.
The long-term impacts of the retreat and related lockdowns may cause the pharmaceutical industry to be disturbed.
The destitute and powerless will be more slanted to utilize drugs hurtfully, create sedate utilize disarranges, and lock in in unlawful drug-related activities—whether generation or transportation—as a result of expanded unemployment and a need of openings.
Sedate trafficking organizations might benefit from this circumstance by making a difference out distraught bunches and enrolling unused individuals to swell their numbers.
These changes might effectively build up themselves as the modern typical in numerous places on the off chance that the government's capacity to reply is restricted.
Development and Complexity
Advertise development
Showcase development is to some degree clarified by populace development designs
Both the outright number of individuals utilizing drugs and the rate of the worldwide populace utilizing drugs have been rising.
In 2018, there were an estimated 0.269 billion drug users, which is 5.3% more than there were in 2009, when there were an estimated 0.210 billion users, or 4.8% of the world's population of people aged 15 to 64.
Sedate utilization has expanded altogether more rapidly in developing countries than in industrialized countries over the past 20 a long time.
This to some degree reflects the reality that worldwide populace development amid the time shifted between industrialized and creating nations, at 7% and 28%, separately, but it moreover reflects the more youthful populaces in poorer nations developing more rapidly.
Youthful individuals and young people account for the larger part of sedate clients.
The populace of this age bunch expanded by 16% within the creating world between 2000 and 2018, whereas it shrank by 10% within the created world.
One figure driving both the show and future pharmaceutical markets is urbanization
Urban zones are more likely than country ones to have a sedate issue, both in created and creating countries.
More than half of the world's populace presently lives in urban locales, up from 34% in 1960, and this colossal relocation from rustic to urban regions is to a great extent to fault for the common rise in sedate utilize.
Urbanization may play a critical part within the dynamics of sedate markets within the future, especially in developing countries where urbanization is more articulated.
Expanded riches is connected to an increment in medicate utilize, but the poorest individuals are most influenced by infection, medicate utilization is more common in created countries than in creating countries in general.
Substances like cocaine are more closely connected to more princely districts of the world.
Comparable to how it is among countries, medicate utilize is more common among the more rich areas of society.
However, individuals with lower financial position move to substance utilize issues at higher rates.
Moo pay and unsafe medicate utilize designs and conditions are related, agreeing to information from a little number of countries.
These patterns appear to be less predominant among financial classes with more prominent riches.
The risks for the foremost powerless people, such as medicate clients, are anticipated to be made more awful by the financial confinements forced by the around the world COVID-19 emergency.
For occasion, the scourge has tossed tens of millions of individuals out of work universally and changes within the labor advertise, such as rising unemployment, have already been related to expanded sedate utilize.
The pharma showcase seem develop encourage as a result of COVID-19, got to take chances and do illegal things.
Due to COVID-19-related imperatives, there may have been an upsurge in trafficking by ocean since it is less likely to be catching and can carry greater volumes of booty than arrive or discuss.
There have recently been rumors of cocaine shipments traveling directly by sea from South America to Europe.
Expanded complexity
Whereas the sum of chemicals not subject to worldwide control is unfaltering, the presentation of unused, possibly perilous opioids is on the rise, the pharmaceutical industry is getting trickier to explore.
Numerous engineered drugs, numerous of which are not controlled universally, have been included to plant-based opiates like pot, cocaine, and heroin. Medicate utilization for purposes other than treating ailment is additionally rising rapidly.
On the residential showcase of Part States, around 500 modern dynamic chemicals are presented each year.
These days, stimulants make up the larger part of these, taken after by manufactured cannabinoid receptor agonists and a little number of opioids.
NPS numbers have stabilized for the most part, but the proportions have moved.
In 2014, opioid NPS made up fair 2% of all NPS found; by 2018, this extent had expanded to 9%.
Overdose passing from NPS opioids, numerous of which are fentanyl analogs, have been reported in North America and, to a lesser degree, abroad.
Fentanyl is utilized in North America to create fake pharmaceutical painkillers or as a doping specialist for heroin and other substances like cocaine and methamphetamine.
There's a few sign that NPS stimulants are infused in Europe as well: Much of the remains from utilized syringes are recolored with NPS, which can deliver stimulants, agreeing to a ponder done on them in six European cities
2 Modern psychoactive sedate utilize seem ended up broadly acknowledged in vulnerable communities
Seldom does a single lesson of NPS make a sizable advertise.
In any case, information from Europe shows that manufactured cannabinoids are a critical issue for socially prohibited bunches counting the destitute and detainees.
22 countries detailed on the utilization of NPS in detainment facilities, and the lion's share of them cited manufactured cannabinoids as a noteworthy impediment.
Forerunner chemical control compels drug makers to enhance, numerous substances that are as often as possible utilized as building squares for opiates counting amphetamine, methamphetamine, and "happiness" have been set beneath universal control.
Medicate makers and traffickers are continually investigating for substitutes, counting not as it were less entirely controlled drugs but moreover substances made intentioned to urge over existing directions, or "architect antecedents."
Medicate producers who depend on antecedent chemicals would certainly feel the impacts of prohibitive measures planning to halt the spread of COVID-19.
Information from Mexico infers that this is often as of now the case: in Walk 2020, Mexico and the Joined together States detailed cost rises for methamphetamine due to deficiencies of forerunners provided from East Asia.
The showcase is changing quickly
In Central Asia and the Russian Alliance, manufactured substances are taking the put of sedatives
From 2008 and 2018, it shows up that the sedative markets in Central Asia and the Russian League have moved.
Whereas less individuals are getting treatment for opioid utilization, the number of sedatives reallocated by Russian League specialists has diminished by generally 80%.
However it appears just like the doping industry is doing well.
There's confirmation that the Russian medicate advertise is right now overflowed with methamphetamine and a few cathinones, such as mephedrone and a-pyrrolidinylvalerone.
More than multiplying in estimate over the course of two a long time, to 152 research facilities in 2018, Russian police detailed a considerable increment in later seizures of incognito research facilities creating a assortment of illegal opiates.
Showcase development for methamphetamine in Afghanistan and Iraq
Examinations of staff individuals in clinics, correctional facilities, and other teach as early as 2012 had demonstrated the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Along with "captagon" and tramadol, crystalline methamphetamine has developed as one of the foremost concerning drugs.
Medicate clients said that cannabis was more troublesome to get than "captagon" or methamphetamine in a 2015 ponder, which backed these discoveries.
The Board has voiced stress with respect to the importation of critical sums of pseudoephedrine arrangements, which are utilized as antecedents by methamphetamine research facilities, in light of the later disclosure of methamphetamine research facilities by Iraqi specialists.
The generation of methamphetamine in Afghanistan accepted to have begun around 2014.
Since at that point, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily expanding.
But compared to the earlier year, seizures within the to begin with half of 2019 come to 657kg, a noteworthy increment.
Considerable methamphetamine seizures in other countries that are assumed to have come from Afghanistan moreover suggest that make in that country is expanding rapidly.
Patterns and Changes in Arrangement
Cannabis utilization contains a inclination to rise in purviews where it is authorized for recreational utilize
The generation of cannabis items for non-medical utilize is legitimate in eleven wards over Canada, Uruguay, and the Joined together States.
The larger part of these locales have seen a rise in cannabis utilize since legalization, be that as it may, other purviews without such enactment have moreover seen this design.
Grown-up non-medical pot utilize has surged, particularly within the past month, and day by day or nearly every day utilize has surpassed the national normal since 2012 in Colorado and Washington, two of the primary US states to endorse laws.
Numerous signs point to an upsurge in cannabis utilize in Uruguay since 2011, with utilization about multiplying within the past month.
This appears that visit and standard cannabis utilize is the essential cause of the rise.
Short-term information from Canada moreover demonstrate that a rise in utilization coincided with the legitimate market's development from 2018 to 2019.
40% of cannabis customers in 2019 in any case proceeded to buy certain merchandise from unlawful sources.
Is the sharp decrease in worldwide seizures of pot herb due to cannabis legalization?
Seizures of cannabis herb plunged to their least level universally in 2018 and had diminished by 84% over the past 10 a long time in North America.
Seizures, in the mean time, about multiplied in other parts of the world over the same time span. Concurring to the seizure slant, directions pointing at liberalizing the pot showcase were a major figure within the drop.
NPS control shows up to have a dissuasive impact, it is still challenging to assess the household control of NPS.
The predominance of NPS utilize changes among a few countries with particular NPS administrative systems.
With the sanctioning of household enactment, the utilize of NPS has diminished in different countries.
Both the legitimate and unlawful sedate markets harmed defenseless bunches, pharmaceutical opioids are for the most part accessible in high-income countries for the treatment of torment and palliative care, territorial incongruities exist within the conveyance of torment mitigation.
In 2018, high-income countries accounted for more than 90% of all medicine opioids that were accessible for therapeutic utilize.
There are 2% in Oceania, 50% in North America, and 40% in Europe.
The populace of these countries makes up around 12% of the complete world.
In spite of the fact that moo- and middle-income countries are thought to be domestic to 88% of the world's populace, they as it were utilize 10% of all pharmaceutical opioids.
Enactment, culture, healthcare frameworks, and endorsing hones are some of the numerous components that might make obstructions to getting to pharmaceutical opioids.
A substance utilize clutter is more likely to develop in those who are less well off, In 2018, 35,600 thousand individuals were influenced by a substance utilize issue.
Destitution, a need of instruction, and social prohibition may make substance utilize disarranges more likely to happen and decline their impacts. Thinks about in high-income countries have appeared that the likelihood of creating a sedate utilize clutter is additionally related with people's antagonistic financial directions, not as it were their status at a specific point in time.
In expansion to compounding financial drawback, sedate utilize clutters can too increment the chance of unemployment, destitution, and vagrancy, making a horrendous cycle of drawback. These discoveries might moreover be associated to the criminal equity system's stigmatizing hones and results.
Individuals in rustic zones, ladies, individuals of sexually assorted bunches, migrants, and individuals of ethnic minorities may too be excessively influenced by substance utilize clutters or have trouble getting to treatment offices.
The disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) marker, which calculates the a long time of sound life misplaced to incapacity and untimely passing, demonstrates that the affect of destructive sedate utilize on society as a entirety has gotten more regrettable over the past ten a long time.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of worldwide disability-adjusted life a long time credited to medicate utilization rose by 17%.
Untreated hepatitis C, which is predominant among infusing medicate clients, essentially expanded the number of DALYs (disease-associated mortality occasions) connected to liver cancer (up to 40%).
It is challenging to set up all causal joins between the utilize of psychoactive substances and savagery since the relationship between drugs and savagery is complex.
Inebriation may play a critical part in crime, agreeing to constrained information from around the world.
In any case, it appears that drinking contributes more to savage occasions than do drugs.
Sedate utilize may contribute to wrongdoing, but this interface may moreover be mostly clarified by a number of intervening variables, counting financial hardship and other sorts of difficulty brought on by individual hazard, family flow, and peer weight.
Viciousness and medicate trafficking are closely related on numerous levels.
On the off chance that steady criminal organizations are in put, large-scale organized wrongdoing, counting universal medicate trafficking, is likely to be carried out without viciousness.
Within the brief term, the nearness and concentrated of viciousness are less subordinate on the sum of trafficking than they are on certain changes that disturbed the pecking order of organized crime, such as shifts within the estimate of the dark showcase, high-profile criminals' downfall or imprisonment, and authorization activities that make one gather more helpless than another.
Most recent patterns
Opioids = most dangerous, marijuana = most used
Cannabis was the top substance used globally in 2018 by 0.192 billion people.
58 million people used opioids in 2018, in contrast.
Few opioid users, unnoticed risks.
50 percent of the 21 million years of life thought to have been lost to drug-related disability or premature death in 2017 and 66 percent of the projected 167,000 deaths from drug use disorders were attributed to substances, Resulting from chemicals.
Synthetic opioid abuse worsens public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is fueling the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The opioid problem is being exacerbated by easily accessible and inexpensively produced drugs in the two locations, which have little in common in terms of economics, demographics, or overall drug usage trends.
A rise in opioid overdose mortality of 20 years has been attributed to the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl in North America.
Fentanyl was involved in two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States in 2018.
Canada reported similar results in smaller numbers.
The variable potency of fentanyl on the black market for illicit drugs is one of the factors contributing to overdose deaths caused by fentanyl.
Tramadol's non-medical market has seen tremendous growth in West, Central, and North Africa.
Tramadol use disorders are being treated on a growing number of patients in the area.
In 2017, the amount of tramadol that was seized internationally peaked at more than 125 tons.
Global seizures, however, dropped to 32 tons in 2018 when India implemented a new rule governing tramadol.
The ease of production, low cost, and absence of international regulation of tramadol and several fentanyl analogs or their forerunners all contribute to the situation in both places.
The availability of these medications in both prescription and illegal markets, which makes it more challenging to identify and stop abuse, exacerbates the situation in both locations.
An increase in doping use
Cocaine and methamphetamine, which both have rising use in their key areas, dominate the stimulant market.
In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it is widely utilized in Western Europe and North America.
In the same year, 27 million people took amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most popular ATS in North America and South-East Asia.
Most indicators show that methamphetamine usage has been rising in both regions for the past 20 years.
Cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist in some markets, occasionally substituting for one another, causing the use of one drug to climb while the usage of the other lowers, or occasionally both rising and falling to satisfy demand in the same market.
COVID-19 increases risk for injecting drug users
In 2018, it was projected that 11,300 thousand people used injectable drugs, and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are linked to injecting drug usage.
HIV infects more than 1 million drug injectors, while hepatitis C affects 5,500 thousand.
Half of the estimated 0.585 million drug-related deaths in 2017 were attributable to liver illness brought on by hepatitis C, which is largely untreated among injecting drug users.
5 Users may substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or combine opioids with synthetic narcotics as a result of opioid shortages brought on the COVID-19 regulations.
Some users switching to injections or injecting more regularly may lead to the emergence of more hazardous patterns of usage.

EU faces admission obstacles in refugee policy talks, says Chinanews com
Conflicts over refugee policy at the EU summit amongst EU officials; obstacles at every stage of the admission process
Global Times' Niu Ruifei reports tighter rules on illegal immigration enacted at the recent EU summit, according to President Ursula von der Leyen, deporting illegal immigrants is easier now.
The EU's action, according to reports, is a reaction to growing worries over illegal immigration in Europe, which is now the main cause of the EU's poor deportation rate of illegal immigrants.
EU leaders requested the Commission to "quickly mobilize substantial EU funding," including through infrastructure and monitoring, to bolster external borders, according to the summit document.
Yet, the EU and member states have clashed over matters including how to pay for the fence.
The expenditures will not be covered by EU funding, according to Von der Leyen.
The installation of cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the EU's external borders would free up national funds and move along more quickly, according to diplomats in several member states.
EU authorities acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every stage of the refugee admission procedure, according to the European Euractiv website, a "Permanent Crisis."
According to estimates from the European Commission, the Schengen member states of the EU received more than 920,000 asylum claims in 2017—a nearly 50% rise from the year before.
Almost 330,000 illicit entry were noted by the European Union last year.
In light of this, the summit also adopted the "principle" that member states of the EU may remove unlawful immigrants in accordance with a court ruling in another member state.
The article also stated that EU leaders decided to "expand the use of the notion of a safe state," which will allow the EU to create a standard list.

US China's "chip war" hits global semiconductor industry
US-China "chip war" to escalate, under US pressure, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to restrict semiconductor machinery exports to China, US may end all relations with Huawei & ban US use, ban on Huawei products, Biden admin ready to issue order limiting US, investment in sensitive C, 2023 is coming soon, the US continues to stifle China's semiconductor sectors.
US sanctions limit China's semiconductor industry and create de-Sinicization alliance, none - "China" is already the shortest possible version of its name.
Whether it be to convince South Korea to create a "specialized organization together," or to make a chip "quadrate alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or to set up a semiconductor industry chain through components such as the "four-party component" of the Joined together States, Japan, India, and Australia, and the "Indo-Pacific Financial System".
The US, however, also uses "harm to the enemy by one thousand and self-injury by eight hundred" as one of its "fundamental tactics" against China.
The recent round of export restrictions on chip manufacturing equipment to China have caused the Lam Group, a well-known supplier of chip manufacturing equipment in the United States, to announce that it will be forced to lay off 1,300 full-time employees and 1,400 temporary workers over the course of the next two quarters.
ASML, a leading manufacturer of lithography equipment worldwide, recently issued a warning that the Chinese export restriction on semiconductor production equipment would result in increased semiconductor pricing.
US companies that make electronic design automation tools, chips, and wafer manufacturing equipment suffered greatly when the US government suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries.
The worldwide semiconductor industry chain and supply chain have been negatively impacted by the alleged American suppression of China's sophisticated semiconductor industry.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech, knowledge-intensive sector of the economy, and a globally interconnected chain of the semiconductor industry has long developed.
Using specialized division of labor, experts estimate that the complete production process for semiconductor devices requires crossing international borders more than 70 times and takes 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor sector has a solid base, its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in terms of modern manufacturing techniques, are relatively limited, and it mainly depends on East Asia.
It is difficult to modify the geographical distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries, even when the United States makes every effort to direct advanced chip production and the supply chain to the regional development of the "little circle" led by the United States.
The worldwide semiconductor industry has been seriously harmed by the United States' aggressive "reshaping" and "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain.
The foundation of the global future industry is the chip, and the growth of the chip industry depends on the involvement of all nations in the globe.
The US passed 3 acts to reinforce its tech advantage: "Innovation and Competition Act," "American Competition Act of 2022," and "Chips and Science Act", It made chip manufacturers establish factories in the US and promoted US leadership in the industry.
The United States has temporarily hampered the growth of China's semiconductor industry and associated sectors while also reaping substantial rewards.
However, in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the US has forced China's chip industry to make constant advancements, depriving itself of the massive Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of US technology companies and harm the growth of the global chip industry.

Fitness industry must address trust crisis
Yet another significant gym "thunderstorm"?
Recently, concerns over the protection of members' rights by the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness have garnered public attention.
Members found their stores faulty since Spring Festival, group members panicked over rumors of closure, prompting intervention from safety, HR, and social security departments.
In the end, the organization's relevant chief executive promised to make great efforts to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers and members, and the uproar died down.
Fitness stores in financial trouble are closed for now, customers can be patient, "Why is 'not good' common among members' responses?"
The crisis of industry trust is the root cause of the controversy surrounding the protection of fitness club members' rights.
Conventional domestic gyms often use a prepaid model, and their evolution was motivated by "making money from users who can't come."
Although it appears that the process of generating cash flow by pre-selling membership cards and building additional locations on a regular basis may be repeated, it is actually hard to establish a sustainable business model.
Consumer confidence is significantly impacted by the widespread distribution of unfavorable information about sectors like running in the gym.
Of course, gyms might be seen as a good business with "money potential" from the perspective of market prospects.
The fitness track has had its ups and downs, but capital has always been interested in it.
Many statistics demonstrate that the market is still growing and that consumption in the arts, sports, and other professions is becoming more and more popular.
With regard to the fitness market, there is a lot of room for growth given the steadily rising living standards of locals and the widespread acceptance of the value of a healthy lifestyle.
The requirement for the industry to focus on development quality increases as the situation improves.
Despite consumption recovery, some institutions were overly optimistic about the fitness market and invested all financing funds in new store construction. 5x5
The epidemic led to institutions withdrawing and business restructuring, big firms are restructuring and acquiring selectively, not a new opportunity.
But, the sector must alter the conventional model and its business strategy if it hopes to enter a positive feedback loop and follow a steady and long-term course.
We can only genuinely win the market and the future by working consistently and regaining the confidence and security of consumers.
The fitness business needs to settle down to maximize services and stabilize users with high-quality development, as opposed to opening additional locations to capture the market.
To keep users, it is first vital to rely on services.
The essence of the service sector, which includes the gyms, is to uphold "user orientation," pay special attention to customer needs, and improve service quality.
To enhance user experience, second, rely on digital transformation.
For instance, the current and widely used Internet gym model allows consumers to pay per view and select their own locations.
Body data and sports data can be used to address societal demands and create a seamless closed-loop service from online to offline at the same time.
Users are less concerned about "running away" from exercise facilities because there is no personal training promotion and no large annual card, and their sense of trust has also increased.
Also, we need to actively investigate other business forms.
Nowadays, watching sports is more like watching a scenario than just one service, fitness centers are anticipated to emerge as new points of access for consumers, sports gear and fitness equipment are examples of peripheral goods that could develop into new profit centers and give consumers more options.

Buy cost distinction discounted!
The Nanjing genuine domain showcase is back, "paying for cost contrast," concurring to Chinanews com

The objective of this "cost assurance understanding," agreeing to Mr Sun's genuine domain expert, is to supply buyers peace of intellect and anticipate them from stressing almost the improvement company's price diminishments, time, you're inconceivably charming given you do not cause trouble.
Indeed in spite of the fact that the "cost security understanding" is assumed to donate buyers "certainty," numerous planned property holders still think the terms are not favorable.

The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds tradition while pursuing innovation.
To handle the relationship between righteousness and innovation, we should not only guard the origin, root and soul of Chinese modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese modernization, and ensure the correct direction of Chinese modernization, but also place innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, respond to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively identify changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously build new momentum and new advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.

We should consider security factors more in development, enhance national security capabilities through development, use the fruits of development to consolidate the foundation of national security, and create a favorable security environment for economic and social development, continuously stimulating development vitality, and achieving a virtuous interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To advance China's modernization in a Chinese way, we must adhere to our own path while broadening our global perspective, persist in opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of China's modernization.
We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, placing the development of our country and nation on the foundation of our own strength, and firmly grasp the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level opening-up, actively participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, broaden the development space of China's modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future through mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.

Companies that are included in the blacklist will face challenges in obtaining technology exports from the United States.
In the list called "Entity List", the company will not be able to purchase technology or products from the US supplier unless the company obtains a special export license from the US Department of Commerce.
The company that has been included in the blacklisted list is: Beijing Nanjiang Kongtian Technology Co Ltd, the 48th Research Institute of China Electronic Technology Group, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Senior Sensors Company and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co Ltd.

China strongly expresses its dissatisfaction and firmly opposes such actions.
The Assistant Minister of the US Department of Commerce, Matthew Axelrod, said: "Today's action shows that we find out and prevent the common efforts of China from using spy balls and these balloons violate the United States and 40 Leading in multiple countries.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co said he was unaware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet made any comments on this information.

((Deutsche Welle Chinese) Days have passed since the earthquake struck parts of Turkey and Syria, and hopes of finding survivors are fading, but the family of five rescued on Saturday was a great relief to searchers.
The family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the hard-hit town of Nurday in Gaziantep province, the Associated Press reported.
The rescue personnel first pulled the mother and daughter out of a pile of rubble, and then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, in harsh and cold weather conditions, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued.

According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has resulted in over 20,000 deaths in Turkey, with an estimated death toll of over 3,500 people in neighboring Syria.
Despite experts stating that a person can potentially survive for over a week when trapped under rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly bleak.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life beneath the rubble.
Meanwhile, the focus of the rescue efforts has shifted towards assisting the survivors who are in urgent need of help.

A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 nonfarm payrolls data, adding 517,000 new nonfarm jobs, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly earnings grew at a slightly slower rate of 4.4% year-over-year and 0.3% year-over-year.
In terms of overall figures, this data may be influenced by several one-time and technical factors, such as the return of striking teachers to work, revisions in survey statistical methods, and updates in seasonal adjustment factors. There could be subsequent revisions to the data (as seen in January 2022 when the initial figure of 504,000 new non-farm jobs was later revised down to 364,000 jobs). Therefore, the non-farm employment situation may not be as robust as the data initially suggests.
From the structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but it accounts for a lower percentage; new employment in high-touch services such as leisure and hotel, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and the data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies, and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US job market will hardly improve without going through a recession.
There is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor force participation rate is moving slowly upward, especially for 25-54 year olds, which is already near its pre-epidemic high.
In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
The ongoing tightness in the US job market's supply and demand will be a prevailing characteristic of the US economy in 2023.
Considering the impending end of interest rate hikes and the continuous fluctuations in inflation expectations, we are not optimistic about the sustained decline in wage growth.
Prior to the release of this data, the US stock, bond, and currency markets had overly optimistic expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's path of interest rate hikes.
As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has continued to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statements, expecting not only an early halt to rate hikes, but also two year-end rate cuts.
In the case of tight labor market supply and demand, the impact of tightening policy is unknown, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance on rate hikes is relatively reasonable, the adjustment of extreme market expectations and the crowded trading may cause some harm to the market.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of payroll growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of each CPI sub-leading indicators, since October the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline in the phase, the stubbornness of payroll growth will only form the bottom of future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, the market may enter a new round of gaming after the next release of inflation data.
"Founder of Sugo Zheng Yonggang passed away due to sudden heart disease, once led the transformation of China's first garment stock - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website”
Economic Observer Network reporter Zheng Yuxin on February 11, announced through a WeChat official account affiliated with Suning Holdings Group Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Suning Holdings") that Suning's founder and Chairman of the Board of Suning Holdings, Zheng Yonggang, passed away on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65, due to the ineffectiveness of emergency treatment for a sudden heart disease.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-run cotton spinning factory. With the transfer, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Sugo Corporation, in 1989
In December 2022, during the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Conference and the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Annual Conference, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, Suning brand had a market share of up to 37%.
In 1996, Sansun (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
While the garment business was booming, the Sugo Group began to transform because Zheng realized that "once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market, and it is unlikely that Sugo suits will always lead the way and become the national costume of the country in the long run.
In 1999, Sugo began to study the transformation of the enterprise, Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "we came to Shanghai to seek what to do in the end transformation, specifically to find a lot of experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings, retreat seminars.
In the end, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction was new energy and new materials, and the other was the future of the health industry.
After the strategic direction was determined, Sugo started to look for cooperation, and at that time, the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute was doing the national 863 project for Anshan Iron and Steel, and the research funds were not enough, so Sugo and the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "intermediate phase carbon microspheres" and engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, so as to realize the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.
In 2001, Suning Corporation achieved large-scale production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres and began domestic substitution, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres in the domestic market.
Indeed, this made Suning Corporation the first Chinese production enterprise for lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials, thus achieving the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials in China.
With the rapid popularity of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugo began to develop gradually and In 2007, the lithium materials business was written into the main business of Sugo, and the revenue share of the garment business decreased year by year until 2013, the revenue of the lithium materials business of Sugo fully exceeded that of the garment business.
In February 2021, Sugo successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer enterprise Sugo Gold Optoelectronics, which is a relatively high technology field, and Sugo's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang has shared his insights on post-investment management, "The probability of success of Chinese private companies acquiring some international high-tech companies is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail?
Because everyone will go to consider, I spent so much money, I have to send people to manage, right, which is usually done an act ", however, Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Sugo, Zheng Yonggang went to Sugo Gold Optoelectronics announced in public, Sugo as the majority shareholder of Sugo Gold, decided to implement a two-enterprise system, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, Sugo enterprise people are not sent to Sugo Gold, to adopt the way of authorized operation, the original distribution system, corporate culture, the management model remains unchanged.
ICC Xinfern information released 2022 negative electrode data shows that the shipment of Sugo negative electrode in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, with a year-on-year increase of 100 % and a market share of 16 %, and the shipment of artificial graphite negative electrode material topped the list.
In the polarizer business, according to Yano Research, the company's Sugene Optoelectronics will reach a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
On the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Corporation revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, Shanshan Corporation share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan
On February 9, Suning Corporation stated on an interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite capacity was approximately 100,000 tons, and the graphite capacity of the Meishan project was still ramping up.
According to Wind Information, Zheng Yonggang is still listed as the Chairman and actual controller of Suning Corporation.
According to the SkyEye search, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1 % of the total equity of Sugo Holdings Co.
The general manager of Shanshan Co Ltd is Li Zhihua, was born in 1968,he has successively served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co Ltd, Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co Ltd, Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co Ltd, and deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co Ltd.
Suning Corporation stated on February 10 on the investor interaction platform that there is no familial relationship between the senior management personnel and the actual controller of the company.
"Fund E Account" is here: China Securities Regulatory Commission authorizes the development of all funds under the investor's name to achieve collection and query - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer reporter Chen Shan, Is it difficult to collect account information due to the complicated purchase channels of funds?
Always forgetting about the "small treasury"?
The issues faced by fund investors are about to be resolved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced that the "Fund E-account" app has been made available on various mobile app stores and is undergoing public trial operation.
According to the introduction, "Fund E Account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" inquiry service for public fund account and share information, aiming to solve the majority of small and medium-sized investors forget account, cumbersome inquiries and other industry service pain points.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, managing a fund size of about 26 trillion yuan; 167 public fund share registrars and 411 public fund sales institutions.
Each share registration institution has its own independent account system, and there is a lack of industry-wide unified channels for querying information.
Some people in the industry said that by the end of 2021, there will be more than 720 million fund investors in my country. This means that half of the people in the country have invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to check their purchases through different sales institutions, but through "Fund E Account", they can check their purchases from all sales channels and see their fund holdings at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to relevant documents, the "Fund E-account" app is a mobile application developed and constructed by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (ChinaClear) with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
Through "Fund E Account", investors can easily and quickly grasp their holdings of OTC shares of each fund manager's public fund products purchased through various sales channels in the market, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, investors can use the "Fund E-account" app to access various information, including their fund account information opened with fund management companies across the entire market, transaction account information opened with public fund sales institutions, and holdings of off-exchange shares of publicly offered securities investment funds, as well as collective asset management plans that are not limited to 200 investors and managed by securities firms.
Liu Yichan, business leader of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told the Economic Observer that investors can get one-stop information about all their OTC public fund holdings through the "Fund E Account" app, which helps them find their "forgotten assets", and more importantly, it realizes comprehensive fund investment information collection for customers, which helps them grasp their investment situation more timely, accurately and completely, so that they can better optimize their fund portfolio allocation and better plan their financial arrangements.
How do I register to use it?
The reporter noted that, at present, the "fund E account" APP has been in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and other cell phone application store shelves, but APP is still in the public trial stage, registration needs to fill in the invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the funds held to obtain.
A medium to large public fund customer service staff in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the Economic Observer reporter, and told the reporter, "APP trial run phase, China Settlement provides each fund manager a certain number of invitation codes, when investors call over to get, we will provide.
After the trial run is over, the invitation code will not be used when opening user registration.
"
According to the official website of the Securities and Futures Commission, the reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry according to the documents related to the download and instruction of "fund E account", the whole process took only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After passing the real-name authentication step, click the "assets" fund binding button, and all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will be displayed in the binding option list (account binding is possible), and you can watch it directly after the binding is completed The total assets of the invested fund can be found and the query function can be used.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides querying services for investors and does not facilitate the buying or selling of funds.

The US, Japan, and the Philippines reach a defense consensus against the CCP
"Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and held talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida."
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing Chinese Communist aggression in the South and East China Seas, and the Philippine and Japanese leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting saying that they will conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to oppose Chinese Communist hegemonic policies.
"According to Japanese media reports, Fumio Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies regarding the Taiwan Strait crisis."
"Bongbong Marcos visited China in early January this year and obtained a deal worth 20 billion US dollars."
"However, after that, the relationship between China and the Philippines not only did not improve but instead deteriorated."
"At the beginning of this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea."
"The newly added base is located 300 kilometers away from Taiwan, and it is also the closest location to China."
"If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may potentially launch operations from bases in the Philippines."
"Japanese media believe that currently, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States, creating a 'curve of countering the Chinese Communist Party' in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation."
Kuomintang vice chairman Xia Liyan visit to convey Song Tao language: under the 1992 Consensus welcome the green camp to visit the mainland
Xia Liyan, the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) from Taiwan, met with Song Tao, the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and Wang Huning, a member of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau, during his visit to China.
In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Chiu Chun-shan, a senior advisor to the KMT's official National Government Foundation, commented positively on Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan that China welcomes green campers to visit the mainland as long as they agree with the "1992 Consensus" and oppose Taiwan independence.
The (KMT) considers this evaluation as a new development.
Earlier, when Xia Liyan met with Song Tao, there was no mention of this statement in the news on the same day.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has for days clarified its refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus.
According to the Central News Agency (CNA) today, KMT Vice Chairman Xia Liyan led a delegation to visit the mainland, and during his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new Director of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee.
The meeting between Xia Liyan and Song Tao talked about the political basis of the Communist Party is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, while Chiu Chun-shan, a senior advisor to the KMT National Government Foundation, said at the meeting that the KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this meeting was different from previous ones in terms of the perceptions and experiences involved.
In recent video talks with mainland scholars, as well as this one, I did not hear Taiwan-related scholars speak of armed reunification and the "anti-secession law," but rather the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the two sides of the strait are fighting fiercely, and mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Due to the lack of mutual trust between the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Communist Party of China (CPC), Zhao Chunshan stated that the CPC still wishes to work for the benefit of the people of Taiwan, indicating that they do not want to worsen cross-strait relations.
According to Zhao Chunshan also said that Wang Huning also personally gave instructions to Song Tao to say "they (Taiwan farmers and fishermen) put forward the request, you must implement", if the overall solution can not be adopted, but also to adopt a case-by-case approach.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang members discussed the daily military provocations by Chinese aircraft and warships near Taiwan, the agricultural and fishing issues in certain counties and cities of Taiwan, or if these topics were raised by journalists from the Central News Agency during the interviews.
French trade unions mobilize again to protest against the government's retirement reform plan`1
On Saturday, February 11, the French labor unions launched another nationwide mobilization against the government's retirement pension reform draft, calling on the public to take to the streets and express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government's retirement pension reform draft.
The number of people responding to the call for the demonstration will likely influence the next steps of the trade union groups' action plan.
This is the fourth time in a month that eight major French trade union groups have come together to launch a national mobilization, and the first time this protest has scheduled a rally on a Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday and they don't have to choose between participating in a demonstration and protest or a wage garnishment strike, union groups are hoping that today's rally will attract more people.
The unions of the public transportation system, the subway, and the public railroad companies are not calling for a strike today, the public transportation system should be able to operate normally and people can take the bus to the meeting place, while people can depart for their vacations normally in the areas where schools have started their winter vacations.
Union groups are hoping for more than a million people to attend the rally today, while police expect the national turnout could be between 600,000 and 800,000, with 90,000 to 120,000 people likely to gather in downtown Paris.
Since the beginning of this protest against the government's retirement reform plan, although opinion polls show that a majority of French people do not support the measure to raise the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets and participating in the demonstrations has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstrations on January 31 rallied between 1.27 and 25 million people across the country
The demonstration on this Tuesday, February 7, saw a decrease in the number of participants, ranging from 757,000 to 2 million people nationwide.
The retirement pension reform proposal is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the ones led by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendment proposals, which have slowed down the deliberation process significantly.
The debates between the ruling party and the opposition have become increasingly fierce and contentious.
A member of parliament from the radical left-wing party France Unbowed recently transmitted a picture of himself on social media with a balloon with the head of the labor minister on his foot, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The President of the National Assembly ultimately announced a 15-day suspension for the member of parliament, effectively barring them from participating in parliamentary activities, as a punishment for their conduct.
Despite the widespread social unrest triggered by this reform proposal, which has been the largest in over two decades in France, the government has made only minor adjustments to the draft without making any significant concessions thus far.
The unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th, and are planning to organize demonstrations on March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion.
China encourages higher fertility rates to universities to promote sperm donation with High quality standards
On the 9th, the Human Sperm Bank in Yunnan Province, China, issued a promotion seeking individuals with a college degree or above, or current students, to donate sperm. It stated that individuals who successfully donate sperm 8 to 12 times would receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message quickly became popular on Weibo and sparked similar initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing.
According to a report by Liberty Times, China is encouraging college students to donate sperm.
Various universities donate sperm among which Beijing donates sperm with the highest threshold, in addition to academic qualification, theyalso requires a height of 170 cm or more, good facial features, no significant hair loss, and a degree of myopia not higher than 600 degrees.
“According to the report, the Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank noted that sperm donors receive a full set of male medical examinations worth 1,000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never had done before and are significant for understanding their fertility status."
The requirements for sperm donors include those who are over 165 cm tall, have a college degree or above or are studying, and have no color blindness, color weakness, hepatitis B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China’s Tianmu News as saying that the Human Sperm Bank in Shaanxi Province printed a promotional poster with “Paid Sperm Donation, Unlimited Glory,” calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages and “let the love spread.”
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than in Yunnan, with qualified individuals receiving RMB 300 cash per visit and a RMB 5,000 subsidy for completing a certain number of sperm donations.
As of now, it is known that Beijing offers the highest compensation, with a maximum subsidy of RMB 5150.
The last communist chancellor of East Germany died today
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95."
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
"
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had divided East Berlin and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Hans Modrow expressed his commitment to helping transform East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, due to widespread protests demanding democracy and freedom across East Germany, Communist party leaders were forced to step down.
After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for reforms in the Soviet-dominated countries of Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as the Prime Minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of attempting to delay the political changes and reunification scheduled for October 1990.
He also faced criticism for attempting to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to prison.
There have been claims that these accusations were politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a Member of the European Parliament.
Modrow considered himself as a reformer and aimed to bring about change within the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want a return to the old East Germany but believed that the achievements of East Germany should be acknowledged.
In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the old East Germany to return but said it should be recognized for its achievements.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in the Youth Fire Brigade and, near the end of the conflict, became a member of the Nazi militia Volkssturm, which enlisted men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final struggle of the war.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a committed communist.
In 1949, the year the GDR was founded, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic and continued his studies in social sciences and economics, earning a doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young East Germans joined, and rose through the ranks of the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) to become president of the Dresden Regional Party from 1973 to 1989.
Indeed, Modrow served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, assuming the highest national position.
Pro-protest hackers hack president's televised address as Iran marks revolution anniversary
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised address.
The president's live television address was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute when a group of anti-Iranian government hackers with the name "Edalat Ali (Justice Ali)" appeared on the screen.
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic" during the interruption.
According to a report by Reuters today, during the commemoration of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, hackers interrupted the national television broadcast.
As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Laissez's hardline government faces its boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Laissez still calls on "deluded youth" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Protests continue to sweep across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September during her detention by the country's moral police.
The Iranian security forces have been engaging in deadly crackdowns on the protest activities, marking one of the most significant challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.
Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on hunger strike as part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
Human rights group HRANA reported that 528 protesters had been killed as of Friday, including 71 minors.
Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said.
It is believed that up to 19,763 protesters have been arrested.
For the past few weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for a vote during Saturday's rally to demonstrate opposition to the protest activities and show support for the government.
On Friday night, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media displayed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!). "
However, many could also be heard at the rally shouting "Death to the dictator!
" and "Death to the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government television broadcasted live footage of official gatherings held in various states across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebration, there were displays of domestically produced ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment.
President Laisi's speech was frequently interrupted by chants of "Death to America," which is a common slogan heard during state gatherings.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel" during the event.
According to Reuters, Adelkhah, who has been imprisoned in Iran since 2019, is one of the seven French nationals detained in Iran, which has been a factor contributing to the deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.
Later, she was placed under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
Just a week before his release, supporters had warned that Mesami was at risk of death due to his hunger strike protest.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday and called for the restoration of her freedom, including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes.

Will the balloon incident brighten the eyes of the United States?
Increased restrictions on technology exports to China
According to The Wall Street Journal's report today, following the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials have stated that the aforementioned balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China, and they will seek more political support to strengthen technology protection in the United States.
The United States alleges that the balloon carried antennas and sensors used for intelligence gathering and communication purposes.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official currently serving at the Washington-based think tank New America's Open Technology Institute.
"This undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire and supports the views of the hardliners towards China."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated to reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking broader actions to expose and address larger-scale surveillance activities by China that pose a threat to our national security as well as to our allies and partners."
U.S officials said they have informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the above balloon incident and that international coordination is essential to address the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the Biden administration's actions, the new House Select Committee on U.S - China Communist Party Strategic Competition could also pressure the United States to take tougher measures to slow down China's development
She stated that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to demand a tougher stance, and this could in turn force the White House to adopt more aggressive policies.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many advocates for stricter export controls are also pushing for an expansion of the regulatory scope to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government has also been developing a foreign investment review program to assess whether US investments overseas pose potential national security threats originating from China.
Analysts suggest that the White House may face calls to expedite the rollout of the program.
Turkey-Syria Earthquake Relief Night and Day
Since the strong earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been tirelessly working day and night amidst the debris of thousands of collapsed buildings, striving to rescue survivors trapped under the rubble.
In the freezing temperatures, they often appeal for silence, as they desperately try to listen for any signs of life amidst the crumbling concrete piles.
According to a recent report by Reuters, two more women have been rescued after surviving for several days in the wreckage of the earthquake.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150 people.
The death toll in Turkey stands at 20,665 people, while in Syria, it has surpassed 3,500 people.
Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
The strong earthquake that occurred in northwestern Turkey in 1999 resulted in the death of over 17,000 people.
Rescuers have pulled two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours after the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, Turkish authorities said on Saturday.
Another injured 55-year-old man has been identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the wreckage of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often appeal for silence as they strive to listen for any signs of life amidst the crumbling concrete rubble.
In the Samandag area of Turkey, rescue workers crouched under a concrete slab, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully reached into the debris and pulled out a 10-day-old newborn baby.
With wide-open eyes, the baby, Yagiz Ulas, was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to a field hospital for medical attention.
Video footage shows that the paramedics also carried away his mother, who appeared dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious and alert.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that in the past 24 hours, 67 people have been rescued from the rubble, and a total of 31,000 rescue personnel have been deployed in the affected areas.
About 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, he said, while 105 million people have been rendered homeless by the quake and are huddled in temporary shelters.
Due to the lack of food for many people in harsh winter conditions, there is an increasing number of public questioning regarding the response of the two countries' leaders to the disaster.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad went to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, according to official Syrian media, it was reported that this was his first trip to the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme (WFP) stated that due to the complexities caused by the ongoing conflict, its stocks are running dangerously low in rebel-controlled northwestern Syria.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adıyaman province, where he acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed by the disaster.
According to Reuters, the anger over the delay in providing assistance and initiating rescue operations could potentially impact the elections. The handling of the disaster and the government's response will likely be a significant factor for voters to consider when making their decisions
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge in Erdogan's two decades in power.
Erdogan called for unity and denounced what he called "a negative campaign for political gain.
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition party in Turkey, has criticized the government's response to the earthquake.
The criticism states that "the earthquake is significant, but what is even more serious than the earthquake itself is the lack of coordination, planning, and incompetence.

The "object" that was shot down over Alaska was what?
confused, speculative
On Friday afternoon (February 10) the US military once more brought down an unidentified flying object over Alaska using the F-22 its most sophisticated stealth fighter plane.
Ten miles off Alaska's coast, it was shot down.
The American military has shot down an aerial object twice in less than a week.
Last Saturday, a Chinese surveillance balloon that had been circling the US airspace for days was shot down close to the South Carolina coast.
The second downed item first entered U.S airspace on Thursday night, was followed by American military personnel as it flew across northeast Alaska, at a height of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), according to the Pentagon, the Chinese surveillance balloon that was earlier shot down is considerably smaller than the automobile, which is around the same size.
Additionally, according to the Pentagon, there is currently no proof that the item is manipulatable.
Although the high-flying object's precise appearance remained unknown, according to White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby, it "posed a legitimate threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
In contrast to the spy balloon discovered in the United States, the object, according to Bryant, did not have a "payload" suspended from it.
"The most accurate description we can currently provide is what we refer to as a 'object'," said Bryant.
Before deciding to send the object down, President Biden followed the Pentagon's counsel, a choice he made "very carefully," according to Bryant.
This object's official US description can be summed up roughly as follows: The flying height is around 10,000 meters, the size is comparable to a compact automobile, there is no joystick, and there is no suspension system.
However, at this time, the information does not adequately address fundamental queries such what the object is, to which nation it belongs, and what function it serves.
Many analyses and conjectures on the Internet at the moment suggest that this could be another Chinese balloon.
It might have originated in China, just like the spy balloon that violated American airspace and the Chinese balloon that flew across Latin America and carried out some sort of operation elsewhere.
This "object" in Alaska has also been linked by some individuals to a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).
Former US Representative Peter Meijer tweeted on Friday, "Wish this 'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO," according to a US Newsweek story.
Major remarked, "although it would be ironic to mistake an extraterrestrial spacecraft for a weather balloon, it would not be worth starting an interstellar war."
The item in Alaska had been shot down, Bryant had just confirmed before Major's tweet.
According to Newsweek, Major was not the only person who thinks the object was a UFO.
Rep Tim Burchett a Republican from Tennessee, condemned the administration's cover-up last month and demanded that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) disclose a report on "unidentified flying objects."
I find Amazon's customer service attitude to be unbelievable
Although it is believed that few people would view this, I still want to add a little.
When we purchased this dress, it had a zipper hood, but I ended up wearing a short-sleeved version.
I immediately contacted Amazon customer support after getting the garments, it was determined at that time that there was still inventory of the clothing, I made a replacement request, after telling the customer care to fix it, they instantly saw that the product's name had been altered to short sleeves, it turned out that the link I purchased from had been withdrawn from the inventory.
The customer service then informed the consumer to either keep the items and get a specified amount of compensation, or return the things.
Does Amazon handle it in this manner?
That wearing the wrong clothes is not a concern for me is very unbelievable, I make reasonable requests as a consumer and don't make any inflated demands, Amazon claims it's out of stock and alters the name.
My first lengthy review, which I hope won't be my last.
The mysterious sleeve
Although it is stated to be made of cowhide and is in fact fairly hard, if you look closely, you will notice that there are numerous tiny fractures in the surrounding area, making it unclear whether the leather is real, additionally, the sleeves on this garment are completely puzzling, the sleeves of coats are typically 1-2 centimeters longer than the hem of the clothing; however, the sleeves of this dress are a full 5 centimeters long, as a result, the arms should naturally hang down in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress cover the fingers.
Both clothing purchases, and returns are simple.
However, I am unsure of when I will receive my money returned?
The garments are well-made, but I had to return them because the size was too small, more than a week has passed since I returned the items, but I still haven't received a reimbursement?
Additionally the buyer must speak with the dishonest Quanfeng Express, the worst shopping experience since purchasing things from Amazon!
However, the store is still nice, actively helping to urge the express to refund promptly, however, Quanfeng Express' actual work is rather frustrating, and the reimbursement is delayed by approximately a month, such a partner would slow down Amazon, yes, ineffective work practices and a lack of service spirit!
Better suited to young individuals
the entire 99 seconds.
The wool pants have good construction, a nice color, a decent amount of softness/thinness, and no kerosene odor.
Sadly, the version is lacking in substance and would be better suited for young individuals.
The waist is a little snug in a 3XL, the flat measurement is 2 feet 5, the maximum stretch is 4 feet, and the weight is 1.79/80 kg.
There doesn't appear to be an elastic band around the waist, and it is really challenging to make the waistline looser.
In addition, wearing it so close to your body is uncomfortable.
Exceptionally good The color is not particularly vibrant
What is happening, I just got it and it increased by more than two hundred.
Amazon had never before used the friendly Tiantianbai Express, the initial delivery wasn't to a residence, I later decided to take the initiative and schedule two delivery times with the courier, The package was returned to me immediately after the courier declined to deliver it, It is strongly advised not to utilize the courier any longer because they have no integrity at all.
This time, I also exchanged a shirt, and when I re-auctioned it, the price went up by more than 100 yuan.
Such products shouldn't appear in the Amazon self-service
After reading the reviews, I decided to get it when it was on sale even though the price is not cheap and the product is also quite good.
I was shocked when I really received the thing, A sizable portion of the product's surface was worn, and there was wear in numerous other locations as well, Either the item was faulty or it was an outdated one, Later the image will be displayed.
I requested a return, and when the manufacturer's representatives saw the image they claimed that transportation was to blame, This is nonsense right?
How does anything get worn down inside?
There are only two possibilities: either the merchandise is faulty, or I purposely harmed the item before returning it.
Objectively speaking, I have no proof that I did not damage the item, but considering my track record of Amazon purchases, I believe that such items shouldn't be included in Amazon's self-operated products, Customers choose to trust Amazon's self-operated products, customer win, we win, I hope everyone will work hard to improve, thank you.
There are two E2s, and I've just been using this product for a little over a year, I'm not sure how to handle it?
I purchased this item on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, red E2 started to show on the two groups on the receiver's right side, the transmitter module ought to be the source of the issue, this is consistent with the transmitter module's ongoing operation, as was noted on the Amazon website, I don't know what to do now because 7 years doesn't quite match and I can't find after-sales support on the Amazon website?
Not bad at all
The initial buy wasn't good.
It doesn't seem brand-new.
Both the label on the fuselage and the label on the box were torn.
And the screen is always white.
Once changed, everything will be fine.
Although the viewing angle is not very wide, the replacement is extremely quick, and it is a little hazy at night; it is sufficient for everyday home use.
The drawback is that there is no card; I paid for it out of pocket and previously purchased a phone from Amazon.
To prevent the package from being opened, there will be a sticker on it, No not now, there is a sticker that resembles a chapter that may be placed to the warranty card when purchasing a mobile phone, No not now.
I'm perplexed, I'm not sure if it's because products are so inexpensive.
Awaiting response from the supplier
Since there is no mark on the package, I called the supplier directly to ask about the matter and was told that the good is authentic despite the lack of a mark, If there is any dispute, I may submit it to Johnson & Johnson for review and include the phone number and license plate information, I swear to tell Johnson & Johnson of my information by text message, Why has a text message not yet been sent to the warranty card on the official website?
Changed the oil in the afternoon, after receiving it in the morning.
Second acquisition.
Self-operated Amazon goods continue to be quite comforting.
The oil was changed by the master, who claimed that it was clean and good oil.
Since this is a second purchase.
I'm still incredibly relieved as a result.
Express shipping is quick, and packing requirements are flexible, the engine noise has greatly decreased after using this oil.
The price-to-performance ratio is favorable, and finding synthetic motor oil for under 200 is challenging.
Support the winning card, the star crown, and successfully defend the vehicle.
Due to customer service issues (8c caterpillars are supplied as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c), Amazon Japan has significantly harmed the interests of buyers
Acknowledging errors but consistently denying and highlighting the fact that the items belong to a third party and cannot be restrained.
Number of the order: 503-4265464-1830254.
I first purchased the 7c, 8, and 9c page size options, I initially believed this to be a trap, I informed Nichia's Chinese customer care that 8 was 8c, However, after the item was sent back to China, I learned that it was actually just 8 cm, according to Amazon's after-sales support, it is a full trap that was set up specifically to catch Chinese people, and as of right now, no such choice is available on the viewing page.
Customer service in Chinese: We apologize for your loss and offer two solutions:
1, You return the merchandise, and the buyer is responsible for all shipping charges.
2, We will give you a reward of 1,000 yen if you do not return the goods.
(I'll calculate it for you: the shoes cost more than 4,000 yen, which is equivalent to 200 rmb; pick 1, I don't have shoes; the loss is 200 yuan.
Option 2, I have shoes, and they finally gave me 2,000 yen in compensation; my final loss was 150 rmb, Customer service: We have it on file and will treat it with care, the following day, I replied to an email and ended the conversation by stating that I would not accept the Chinese customer service's mode of resolution.
I suggested: Have you folks gone to see the caterpillar page where the buy page contains perplexing possibilities like 7c, 8, and 9c, and Chinese customer support helped me inform you that Japanese common codes do not include c, similar to 140?
Both have a mixed label scenario with American and Japanese codes.
In addition, why do you place 8 cm between 7 cm and 9 cm when it is definitely the smallest size.
Chinese customer service: We offer Chinese service, but since we are unsure whether you'll be sending it back to your own nation, we are unable to cover your shipping expenses.
This reasoning baffles me once more, I need Chinese customer service despite being Japanese, Customer service from Chinese speakers in Japan is unnecessary, the ability to place international long-distance calls is not a talent that visitors to Japan possess, who needs to call, This then becomes a question, nothing more than regular purchasing for me, Amazon is buying Chinese phones from other countries.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service simply more practical for those of us who shop from abroad?
This acquisition falls short of expectations
I've purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon twice already, my baby was 2 months old when I purchased a box of diapers, I decided on diapers made of imported European paper, I was happy with my first buy in general, All night, the infant used them, without changing diapers, one diaper can last 12 hours.
However, I purchased L-size diapers this time, 2 packs, each packed separately, are contained in a box, When I opened it, the paper felt loose, which is certainly not the case with imported Pampers, red rash and further symptoms.
But after using the second pack of diapers, the infant developed a rash on the inside of his thighs that hasn't yet disappeared.
The 2 products in 1 box might not be of the same quality, in my opinion.
Should not make further purchases in the future!
Hope to be mindful of package shipment protection
Since I've been doing a lot of internet shopping, this is the worst wrapping and shipping I've ever encountered, there are absolutely no protective measures, such as cushioning foam, wrapping materials, or cushioning layer materials, etc, nothing at all.
Just a box that is crumpled and distorted.
Additionally, the card box had been forced open and twisted, and the soft plastic box within had been packed.
I'm hoping it's real and of guaranteed quality, In the future, I won't have the guts to order anything from Amazon.
I'd rather pay half as much in China and get a warranty.
And the issue with product packaging hasn't changed in 19 years, according to comments I read in 2016, Someone left a comment about it.
It demonstrates how poorly Amazon responds to customer complaints and how far behind domestic rivals JD dot com and Tmall it is.
It's encouraging to see, although there is some disappointment
The color of the entire cup is my favorite, orange red, and even though my family is all boys, I believe orange red and yellow are extremely appealing.
It's smaller than I expected, but it's designed to be removed, so it's fine.
I brought it home and gave it a shot last night, the space between the straw and the bottle cap was too close when the bottle cap was pushed off, because the straw is vertical, my son had to catch the bump on the top to sip water, I believe this location can be enhanced.
Other manufacturers of straw cups appear to tilt the straw, which makes sense, children's items are very concerned with safety and comfort.
Lightweight and huge capacity
I like how light it is, and how spacious the entrance is, but two distinct compartments are a bit unnecessary for me, and I'm not sure what to put into it.
After purchasing it, I discovered that another brand that is nearly identical is available on Overseas Buy Meiya for less than 200 yuan.
Counterfeit, counterfeit is quite powerful
Amazon sells counterfeit goods, and I'm confident of it.
The goods cannot be returned, according to customer service, because it has been used. How can I tell it's a fake if it's not used?
I am unhappy because of trust, after all, it is a face-wiping product, you should purchase it in a physical store, it is acknowledged that it is more costly.
Because it is a surge, I did not read the comments, I've submitted it to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform, let us all work together to protect our rights.
Is it damaged?
Counterfeit goods?
Simply put, tragedy.
The pores on the second piece were fine when I used it, but there was an odd smell when I opened it, I hadn't used this one before, so I assumed it was typical, but when I placed it on my face, I couldn't tolerate it, it has a strong fragrance, I pulled it off right away to wash my face since it is so unbelievable smokey that I immediately coughed out, my eyes stung, and tears started to pour.
Another slice of the same kind, which doesn't have a strong smell and is currently being applied, was opened by Buxinxie.
Now that I think about it, the hair salon kind of smells like terrible perm water.
I can't fathom, is it really that tough to stop using Amazon's self-operated skin care items going forward?
Untrustworthy businessman ah
The event page stated that after I spent 99 yuan on it, I would give away the "Complete Works of Three-Body Problem", I didn't have this present when I got the products, when I called customer service, I promised to present the screenshots of the occurrence at hand, who purchased the items and took the website screenshots is the subject of the query, ah you see, you need consumers to give you the services you have performed for yourself, buyers should be cautious the next time and save the proof.
Feelings following use
I made my first Amazon purchase with this one, I have some relevant experience, first, let me discuss how it feels to finish a product, the first benefit is that it has no unpleasant taste or sensation, Overall, it's excellent, observe for 8 minutes, overall, it is good because after using it once, you need to continue observing, and you will know if you continue to use it, wipe it left and right and it will come off, but there will be a small amount of hair residue on it, which cannot be seen until you look closely.
Whatever the case, I think this is a really great thing.
The second thing is placing an order on the 27th and receiving the items on the 12th, a total of 15 days, or half a month, the delivery team at Amazon also has a very good customer service attitude.
Third, disregard Amazon's Black Friday, the price drops by around 12 yuan if you order on Friday and wait 2 days, thus I paid more than 170 (plus shipping), prices seem reasonable.
According to the customer service, the pricing changes, I've been keeping track of the pricing for more than 10 days, and it remains this way with only a small amount of variation.
Affordable pricing, Chinese name, produced in Japan, with granules, would definitely buy again!
The paste has granules, feels perfectly refreshing, and leaves teeth with a smooth finish after usage, it is superior to a used item by a wide margin, although it claims to be imported, several items lack Chinese labelling, I don't know where they are purchased in wholesale.
I won't ever shop at second-hand stores again, as long as Amazon has it.
Please make a suggestion, as to why the listing on the Amazon app occasionally cannot be submitted, as I would like to enhance some apps, so that they perform better and better!
Over the years, Excellence has deteriorated to the point where there is no quality of service to speak of!
Garbage Excellence does not regard the demands of the consumer, when placing an order, please specify the specific delivery time of 19:00-22:00.
Mail delivery is only practical at night since some elderly individuals find it uncomfortable to stay in bed after surgery.
Surprisingly, the outcome is delivered without prior telephone communication at 12:00 noon, immediately to the door.
Why bother making a time for the consumer to choose if the delivery time is that your courier may deliver it whenever he wants?
Don't undertake any e-commerce if your own logistics can't ensure the service!
Allow an elderly man with 3 wounds to get out of bed and open the door for the messenger, and then he must locate change to for the cost!
Clearly, the order includes a phone number!
Nobody contacted to explain anything from the start to the finish!
A bunch of imposters that pose as employees at Excellence dot com so-called complaint customer care will quickly listen to your issue before offering you a purported solution.
There will be no modification or payment!
Similar issues have occurred before, and I was able to tolerate them, such as an incorrect delivery date, but this time it is too much for me to handle!
You shipped the book to the client while still not paying attention to the fact that the back cover and front cover of the new book were sideways when it came after the pre-sale?
No one will contact you if you leave a negative comment.
Over the years, Excellence has deteriorated to the point where there is no quality of service to speak of!
No more money will be spent on Excellence.
The visual quality is quite poor
The photo selection, formatting, and printing in this book are truly awful given the title "Ancient Atlas", Some images even contain mosaics, but they are so blurry that it is impossible to tell what they are.
The exquisite medieval manuscripts left by the ancestors in the catalog should be worthy of this book, even though it is not a professional atlas and only a small-format image!
(In addition, numerous images can be acquired from sources relevant to the industry in clean original formats), what distinguishes the use of such images in book construction from the absence of images?
！ Such a scholastic spirit makes me feel sad.
There is no commentary on the text, because every family is unique.
2 stars altogether.
In my sophomore year of high school, I read this novel, to pass the time, I read and played games, I believe that I shouldn't be so dependent on a book, after all, I had previously found Qidian's web articles to be somewhat unappealing.
Subsequently...it fell into the pit.
This premise makes it seem like the entire book is rather carefree and joyful, because of Ye Xiu's blood in the first half, while Ye Xiu was still playing the online game, even the guild intrigue was not overly intense.
Regarding the competition portion, I wrote about the passage of time and the juxtaposition of the old and modern with a hint of melancholy (maybe I am sentimental).
I read the entire book in my second year of high school, which required a lot of study time, but I couldn't put it down.
The character and emotional lines described in Full-time are truly wonderful, Some characters, who are only sporadically introduced, have a profound effect on the audience, for instance, Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng have a lot of followers since they are more concentrated characters, even the characters that are not part of the writing core, such Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu, are endearing, nobody can discover a particularly grating character in a cool piece on e-sports, this character description is a complete success.
Regarding the emotional line, there aren't any of the 30 million harem beauties who are decried in common web publications, either they are gorgeous or they are evil, everyone's feelings are expressed in the complete language, and they all share the desire to triumph honorably and enjoy the game of glory.
Everyone seems so innocent and adorable, and there are just little conspiracies.
There might not be any unpleasant full-time jobs for this reason.
This is due in large part to full-time IPs.
Full-time is still a terrific book even when the cultural phenomena of internet writing is disregarded.
He will essentially give a tiny touch and some hot blood.
In April of this year, animation will be full-time.
In fact, I've wanted to acquire this collection of books for a while, but I've put it off since my wallet isn't thick enough, then, when I went to purchase it, I discovered that there were many fakes on tb, in truth, the cover image was just released in a different version by the full-time, I visited Amazon and ordered a set all at once because I personally really enjoy it but still intend to purchase the older version first.
Let's now briefly discuss the state of the products.
●The fourth book doesn't have a plastic cover, but it is brand-new.
●The seventeenth book is still in its plastic packaging, but it has been opened, its texture is also quite odd, and it is not as hard as the others.
●The 23rd book is identical to the 17th book, however, it is older and harsher than the 17th book.
●Individual novels are published by various companies, in contrast to the others, it appears that the 23rd and 17th are published by the same company.
●Overall, I'm happy with the outcome, a sizable box contains 24 books, and I am pleased with my purchase.
The abandoned lion cub
I assumed the book would be as straightforward as "The Lost Corner" when I first acquired it, but there are actually a lot of words!
I had to read this book to the kids three times before I was done, A small lion that is proficient with a firearm, a small lion who adores marshmallows.
I was a little uneasy when I saw the plot about the lion eating the hunter, Animals eating humans is an arrangement that modern urbanites cannot support.
This tiny lion who thrived in human civilization ultimately lost himself, Both a whole lion and a full man, he is no longer.
In the end, all that was left was the small lion's back, and I have no idea what happened to him.
Maybe the grown-up kids will still remember this small lion years from now, and if she is unintentionally reminded of it one day, it might move or inspire her.
Portfolio that is economical
1, I wasn't familiar with TASCHEN previously, but recently I bought a lot of their books, This is because they are simply too effective, whether it's the choice of topics or the quality of the production.
This piece of work has undergone 3 revisions, The three sizes are: the largest, which is roughly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, the medium, which is roughly 36 cm long and 23 cm wide, and the smallest, which is this version, A book box for two volumes is also included.
Personally, I believe it to be appropriate, First off, it's inexpensive, and it comes in two paperback volumes with a combined total of more than 700 pages, It differs from Michelangelo's full works, which are primarily made up of paintings, in two ways, the majority of Da Vinci's manuscripts are in black and white, this edition is the most affordable for readers with tight budgets and non-art majors to appreciate paintings and writings.
2, The painting section explanation is excellent, including composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical context (such as the Last Supper), but I'm not sure if it's the printing or the book's size, The details cannot be properly seen because of certain too-dark shadows, pity.
3, The manuscripts of Da Vinci include a lot more information than those by Michelangelo.
The former is already a genius, whereas the latter's body of work and accomplishments are insufficient to qualify them as geniuses.
You will be rendered absolutely dumbfounded after reading the manuscripts if you could only comprehend half of Da Vinci from the artwork before.
Whoever purchases it will regret it, it is garbage!
I seldom leave negative reviews, but this is truly awful and buying it is a waste of money, God horse, please tell me why!
1. The journey time is incorrect; then, all of a sudden, it is January 1st, and the time resets to zero.
2. Subpar belts are not silicone-made, and blisters on the wrists cause an allergic reaction.
3. Frequently unable to connect to a mobile phone.
4. There is only a five-day battery life.
5. The time is 0 and there is no indication of sleep detection.
6. Not water-resistant.
7. Others.
A slow logistics system
Although it appears to have arrived on October 16, it was actually just received on October 21, Poor reviews!
That delivery is awful, I didn't anticipate Amazon shopping to be this slow, but it is already slow!
Overall fulfillment
Initially, I was concerned about the camera's packaging, but this time everything was fine, the camera comes with an inflatable bag, it comes in the same three sizes, it can be registered on the official website, the number of shutter times is 0, and the remaining features can only be tested over time.
The delivery pace is really quick, I want to voice my displeasure with the messenger here, the items are left with the concierge, and disappear quickly, in front of him, I am unable to inspect the package, I'm completely at a loss for words.
Prior to delivery, the retailer did it for the benefit of the customers:)
The retailer is acting more responsibly by contacting especially to inquire about the camera's screen size, which is done for the customer's benefit.
Additionally, shipping happens quickly.
The Diamond film is also very appropriate and effective.
Uncharged battery
The equipment is excellent, why is it not fully charged after the initial charge, and why is the charging indication continually red?
I am limited to providing comments in product reviews because there isn't currently an official Amazon feedback route
1. I bought the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel on March 29, and it says it would be delivered to my device on March 31, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website at this moment (since it has not yet been released);
2. The price of the book's electronic version on Amazon has been lowered to 18 yuan, and the content of the book that was pushed to the device on March 31 is blank;
3. I have tried several times over the past two days to remove the downloaded blank book from the device and synchronize it again, but I am unable to download "The Essence of Business" in its entirety, however, I can see that the book can be previewed on Amazon's official website.
So far, I have a few ideas
1. The price issue is not the most crucial one, the trick is to figure out how to swap out the empty books on Kindle with books that have actual substance rather than just downloading them indefinitely and saying "stay tuned"
2. The book that was preordered shouldn't be purchased again in the future, after all, the process appears to be exceedingly difficult if the ticket is bypassed, followed by the download of a book with no content;
3. I'm hoping that Amazon will make a regular channel available for input on these problems, there will be a place to provide feedback when there are questions concerning the download or use of e-books (you can refer to Microsoft's official mall for instructions on how to do so through work orders or online customer care, both of which are appropriate)
Reading is not highly advised
I happened to notice it because I read about it a long time ago, so I'll just write from memory.
This book is more of a collection of fragments about love in life than it is a compilation of short stories.
The plot of this novel is as quiet and flat as a street in the middle of a summer afternoon, the tone of the book is similar to that of plain water, and the words and sentences used strive for the utmost simplicity.
Each short narrative is a snapshot of a moment in everyday life that has no beginning or end.
In the end, they were compiled under the heading "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."
I consider the title of this anthology of novels to be a type of performance art, the author aims to convey that love is more than only the emotions experienced on stage, the rocks and dry sea in urban tales, and the bond that binds you and I together, not only should the aforementioned not be seen as a representation of love, but also of a life that is dull day in and day out, as plain as water, with a loss of life, denial of reality, and uncertainty about the future.
While you read this book, images of the quarreling couples around you, the uninteresting marriages of individuals you know, and the unsatisfying relationships can be running through your head.
Since the writing and plot of this book are dull from an artistic standpoint, I do not advocate reading it, unless your life is difficult or sweet, like living in a candy castle, you will feel uncomfortable when you are forced to read it, not strange and dull.
In contrast to Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera," the daily narratives did not engage viewers or broaden their perspectives in terms of depth of thought, and the brief clips did not address any issues, such as What type of error caused the failure of love?
What led to the marriage of the main character's failure?
Because this book doesn't make much sense whether you read it or not, I do not suggest reading it.
This book's reading experience is generally subpar since the author's thoughts are conveyed more effectively through technique and genre than through a clear narrative.
It is appropriate for skimming, not for close reading.
This book's logic is sound, but it lacks sufficient content.
It provides an explanation of what and why numerous sales philosophies exist, However, it is lacking in practical advice, it does not offer any concrete solutions; it only indicates the direction.
Furthermore, the book feels like a patchwork.
There are both domestic and foreign entrepreneurs or salespeople, for example, as well as unknown individuals.
I'm not sure if it's fiction compiled for the sake of illustration, but it would be more believable if certain cases experienced by the author were provided.
We modify the title of customer or client.
The text becomes a customer, but the title continues to be a client.
The e-book also contained errors, missing punctuation marks, and improper numbers.
In essence, while this book is a fantastic introduction to theory, it is not appropriate for individuals who are currently in sales and want to enhance their sales level.
Understand the Internet financial guidebook quickly
This book is quite brief, you could say that it serves only as an introduction to Internet finance, if you want to grasp it in depth, however, you will still need to follow the road map and do some independent research.
Because the book was written earlier, it does not include information about Alipay and WeChat's subsidy war to shape user habits, the third-party payment share in use today is most likely not as low as the book claimed.
Because the book was written earlier, it does not include information about Alipay and WeChat's subsidy war to shape user habits, the third-party payment share in use today is most likely not as low as the book claimed.
However, I am quite appreciative to the author for penning this introduction, it is evident that the author has at least years of experience in financial observation and is well-versed in both domestic and international financial development history, as evidenced by the fact that he is able to produce such comprehensible information.
Tall and meaningless writing is simple to do, but writing in an understandable manner is difficult.
I value you and wish to tell you more!
Not the amount of pay, but rather whether or not a person feels valued and given enough attention at work, is the primary determinant of job happiness.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory states that when people's basic needs for survival are met, it is imperative to meet their psychological needs-- in order to feel understood, validated, and valued.
In fact, the majority of Chinese people are "I love you hard to express" people who will keep their feelings of adoration, thanks, and appreciation to themselves and refrain from expressing them out loud.
The author of this book explains the five languages of appreciation: physical touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, and desirable gifts.
Not knowing the five languages of appreciation, in my opinion, is more significant than being able to express appreciation and gratitude to those around you whenever and wherever you are, whether they be close friends, family members, or coworkers.
In fact, the closer individuals are to us, the more we need to show them respect and appreciation for them, in order for our lives to improve.
Recognize your worth so that you can help businesses keep people on board longer and cut down on turnover.
We are grateful to the translator for introducing us to such amazing foreign ideas and cultures.
There are more or less linguistic distinctions,, because of factors like the cultural backgrounds of Chinese and Western people, I think you will learn more if you have the chance to see the author's original work.
Once more, I'd want to thank the authors, translators, and editors for their labor of love!
Please conduct a thorough review, of suspected counterfeit goods by Amazon
The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it is not even as good as street stall products, there is no weight, there is no barcode, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose, which is not a characteristic of qualified products at all; it is the worst shopping experience I have ever had on Amazon, and I have requested a return, it is entirely a quality issue; traders should retain an open mind and shun substandard goods, supplement: I purchased a heart-to-heart, 23 yuan/10 roll from a supermarket and attached a few comparison photographs to confirm the product's authenticity, clearer references to avoid financial loss and more dissatisfaction!
Once more, I anticipate that Amazon will be very careful and cautious about the origin of the products.
A gap exists between expectations and shoddy products
Benefits:
1. A well-known brand, affordable price.
Benefit 2: PANASONIC guarantees the motor and blade, and it is safe to use, however, it falls short of my expectations.
Disadvantages:
1. Because there is no indicator light for charging, your power indicator is essentially preserved, according to estimates, PANASONIC considers customers who purchase goods worth 300 yuan to be disrespectful and giving.
2. There is a powerful smell, even after only 10 minutes of charging, you can smell the pungent odor of burning plastic.
I gave it a try for 1 day in the office, and the entire place smelled like plastic.
Although there is an additional cutter head compared to the PHILIPS of the same price I previously used, the quality of this Panasonic product is truly regrettable for customers.
Little Package
I knew it had fallen down the hole once more when I opened the express delivery and saw the e-commerce version, compared to the supermarket version, it was smaller, it ought to be M, in contrast to the product introduction picture, the package is different, the allegedly new version, the so-named new edition.
I only gave it three stars because I was careless and didn't carefully read the product details, I have no issue with you offering the M-size online version for sale, what does it signify that the edition of your product is incorrect?
Since e-commerce processes are complex, I still go to the grocery store to make purchases when I have time.
The sauce alone.
Dislike the flavor
The kid doesn't particularly enjoy the flavor of toothpaste, and always claims it's spicy, perhaps a different word would be more suited to describe it, currently the child's vocabulary consists of just this one word.
I am ashamed of leaving a negative review, maybe four stars, but I won't purchase it again because I purchased it at an event and it was extremely inexpensive.
Sincere yo, attractive packaging
There are no internet reviews, merely a bare product, and the packaging is very thorough, with an air bag inside.
There is still a coating of plastic film on the bottle's outside packing, as shown in the photograph, and the express shipping is also very swift, arriving the next day after I took the photo.
It's authentic, but it's out of stock, and I'm not sure when it'll come back.
A poor shopping encounter
I ordered on Black Friday, but despite waiting a long time, I never got the item, the box had already been signed for when I checked it later, my coworkers denied signing for it when I questioned them about it, I called the courier service right away, but they told the sender should make the inquiry, over ten days passed after I contacted Amazon customer service, the messenger was inadvertently sent to someone else, I finally realized, I eventually recovered the courier after a few rounds, the product is still intact despite the removal of the outer packing, I'm not sure if it was ever used, No, it's still fairly horrible
Wrong photo
I expected to get a headset similar to Figure 1, but instead I got a headset like Figure 2, the visuals being inconsistent is acceptable, but what does it imply that the volume on the left and right earbuds differ?
Despite the fact that the names are the same, I still hope that everyone will pay attention, to add, I also request that the Amazon administrator quickly replaces the appropriate image, I appreciate you.
Moderate operating system
After using it for a while, I can't really see the difference, but overall the picture is not horrible, however this system makes people look jumbled, boots up slowly, I can't make proper settings, and the software I bring is not required, when compared to my colleagues' responses, the response time is not significantly slower after commenting.
Although it is described as having a very user-friendly design in the comments, I couldn't discover any examples of a human-friendly design, Up, down, left, and right are the often utilized remote control directions, and the back button's placement is actually not very attractive.
So, just utilize it as a TV, and use a TV box or something similar.
The price cut is too substantial
More than 100 yuan is now only 99, a too-strong price reduction!
I have a ton of unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I use a paraphrased passage as the evaluation content.
If I evaluate based on this section, it indicates that the product has at least 85 points or higher.
If a product is subpar, I will never be so lazy to copy and paste reviews so that future customers can use them as a guide when making a purchase and the seller can raise the standard of the product as a result.
If you don't have a fever, this is plenty given the low price and good line
Despite being so inexpensive, the cable should have met the requirements for HDMI certification, the cable body is thick and supple, and the transmission across the 7-meter distance is noise-free when compared to domestic Akihabara rubbish (which costs twice as much), In the future, keep an eye out for Baseus' low price line!
Things are fine, but Amazon's customer service is significantly inferior to that of competing websites
I realized my error after I placed the order, but I am unable to cancel it, the incorrect link was always presented when I tried to contact the website's online customer support, so I was unable to do so.
The delivery person contacted me after the package had been delivered, and I informed him that I no longer wanted it, when I tried to cancel an order but it was not accepted, the delivery man carried it back and asked me to sign for it before letting me request for a return.
I was informed that after the food is signed for, it cannot be returned and that there is no way to contact Amazon customer service when I requested a refund, likewise, the sign cannot be exchanged in this situation.
I have purchased things from Jingdong and Suning, including milk and diapers, that are not returnable in accordance with the rules, when I contacted customer service, they were reimbursed, but Jingdong diapers were excessively pungent after they were opened, the customer support still responded after I called them, when you get to Amazon, you cannot do it.
Rules are no longer valid, people are still living, what should you do? Contact your customer service
Tell me I have the option of accepting it personally, or letting the courier make the purchase on his own, why should I let the courier pay for something I didn't buy when it is not easy for the courier?
Okay, I accept it myself and will not want a refund, but I must give your service 1 point
My advice to you is to avoid wasting money
I am eager to purchase it, first and foremost, the Dole brand shouldn't necessarily be awful, in my opinion, I examined the package when I first got it and deemed it adequate, the size is not bad, but there is a box that is essentially soft, which cannot be seen from the outside, to feel tasteless in the mouth after eating, bland and tasteless, the flesh surrounding the bite is dark yellow, that is the kind that is broken, good and bad are sold together, and less than one-third of the edible ones, I would advise against buying anything because it is extremely expensive and of poor quality
Never again purchase fruit through online commerce after making this mistake!
Where is the security seal for the product
The bottle's bottom corner is substantially dented, which should be the result of a powerful hit, from the outer packaging bag, it is alarming to see the extent of the damage, after all, despite the food's overly basic packaging, it is nevertheless sold abroad, have you noticed any blatant counterfeit prevention signs? The bottle is really simple to open, the crucial feature is that the honey layer in the top spills out right away, when there is an opening, adhesion is essentially nonexistent, are all imported goods the same?
I'm confused, being Chinese by birth.
It ought to be authentic, right?
When I shot the picture, there was also a notification indicating it would arrive on the 20th, on the 14th, I got this one, this is my first buy from abroad, I simply noted my reservations, perhaps this is typical?
Improved pick-up service is required
I purchased 5 delivery coupons in total, I had scheduled a time to pick up 3 coupons, but only 2 were delivered when I went to pick them up, after numerous communications, it was determined that they had been overlooked and that new copies of them were required, the second appointment arrived right on schedule, there was unnecessary worry produced because neither the website nor WeChat mentioned the need for an appointment on weekdays on the final rest day, it is advised to get better in the future.
Pleasant shopping
Nice stuff!
I still have faith in Amazon's autonomous products, the shipping period is now only a few days longer than domestic ones, making it incredibly simple to purchase internationally, I must admit that Amazon still has excellent customs clearance capabilities for purchases made outside of China; this is quicker than transshipment, nowadays so many products are bought abroad, which is much faster.
I hope that domestic items' quality and cost can improve, even though many items are made domestically, buying them elsewhere rather than in China is more affordable, I want it to get better.
Rubbish
I want to question everyone: Do you think this package by the side of the road is trash after seeing it?
From the so-called Germany, a delicate plastic box is sent in a plastic bag, is a package like that accountable?
This kind of packaging is, in my opinion, packing garbage, when I purchased this item, the packing was quite straightforward, there was nothing in place to stop harm, it was merely a plain plastic bag, when I received it, the contents of the shipment and the entire package were entirely ruined.
I will recognize it and purchase a number of these if I only come across one like it, when I contacted Amazon customer service, they informed me that the shipping price may be reimbursed but that it would first need to be paid and would then be given to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask you this: I pay the shipping charge in cash; will I receive a gift card in return, As a result, I will need to purchase your gift card on my own, I have to mail the item to the German warehouse, purchasing a thing is not illegal at all!
I have been asking the customer support who is accountable for the issue, but they have refused to acknowledge any responsibility and will not even accept it for a single word, what kind of warranty is offered for this type of post-purchase support? Planted! However, I anticipate that Amazon won't allow me a chance to publish my evaluation, so I'll just erase it
Excellent quality, 5 stars but very subpar logistics
1, The price is excellent, the quality is really good, and the cost is reasonable.
2, Sturdy construction, ample material, solid solder joints, appropriate surface finishing, and attractive color.
3, The logistics are inefficient, the order was placed on March 3 and was delivered on April 11.
4, I might be quite happy if Amazon didn't list February 7th as the estimated arrival date.
5, However, indicating the anticipated arrival time equates to making a guarantee to the user, the user will feel quite uneasy if the promise cannot be kept.
6, If you are unsure whether to make a promise, don't make one.
7, In reality, I am cautious about merchants' promises.
8, As a result, my grade was dismal.
Color will fade from gold thread
The influence is still present, but depending on the person or the psychological effect, the emotion may or may not be noticeable.
The gold thread is one item that is not ideal, although the gold thread was intended to appear attractive, it will eventually deteriorate, there will be some issues in your hands and on the car if you put it on the car and hold it a few times, a little gold dust.
I wish the product could be enhanced.
Do not attach gold wires to this type of square form because they have no decorative impact and could cause problems if they came off and stained the car.
The goods are in good shape, and the delivery time is adequate, they come in 2 separate bundles that are broken up differently
8 days is a rather quick turnaround time, but it comes in 2 separate shipments for 2 items, and the packing is not the same, one is obviously too shockproof, It is secured with substantial cardboard and covered with plastic, disassembling the outside package is also simple, domestic is the other, It's like a courier box, and adding a few cushioning airbags is acceptable, albeit it feels a little pointless.
Yalan mattresses are excellent
Since the mattress is only 34CM thick, you can sleep on it alone without a bed.
I immediately fell asleep while lying on it since the quality is excellent, the sleep is quite nice, and it is pretty soft whether it is the front or the back.
Due to the rough expedited transportation, there were some stains on the mattress when it was delivered.
Amazon is shameless, and the product is not self-operated
The self-operated label on the page is very obvious, In actuality, the provider delivers it, and the supplier is in charge of after-sales, make your own contact with the supplier if there is an issue.
Sorry, but once the order information has been forwarded to the supplier, it cannot be changed, if you want to return the item, and you have successfully requested a return on Amazon, I'm sorry, but nobody is concerned; you must get in touch with the provider on your own to return the item.
This damn self-operating thing. What kind of thing is it?
Amazon does not deliver the item, and it also does not assume liability for the after-sale support, even the customer service stated that it was self-operated and said, "I will help you contact the supplier", It is clearly cheating customers and is shameless!
A miserable experience
My online purchases of filter elements from different businesses have good filtration properties, I use them for an additional day or two without a scale beyond the initial 28 days.
Since the quality of items purchased on Amazon can vary, this time consider buying on this side, the first time to buy a cartridge in Amazon does not feel very good, not only is it early to start the scale, but after the cartridge has been used for 28 days, there will be suspended small black carbon powder, I really do not know whether to continue using, or just throw away good, very depressed~
Not what was anticipated
The outward construction is mediocre compared to other plug-in boards I've used in the past, and the internals haven't been taken apart, I hope it matches the store's description, there is no indication of whether each autonomous unit is turned on from the standpoint of usability
While waiting for the right moment to assess the product's quality, the box is damaged.
While the box inside appears to be brand-new and the outer wrapping is severely damaged, the manual does not appear to be brand-new, the stock is available, yet the renovations were barely completed in September, I'm hoping it won't be damaged by then, Please elaborate on why numerous customers brought it up, although the wrapper is destroyed, you can handle it carefully, I appreciate it!
Overall good with minor issue
This is the first water filtration jug I've ever purchased, after reading a few evaluation articles, I decided that LAICA was the most economical option, I installed the filter element after receiving the product and doing so in accordance with the directions, the treated water and raw water will be combined when released from the spout (the raw water tank is not completely sealed).
When using, make sure to let the water finish filtering completely before emptying it!
Unfinished image
This bead is made in Thailand, but there is no indication of origin, this is two; there is no indication of texture, this is three; I purchased it in the United Kingdom, where clearly each item has a box, here there is only a simple plastic bag, and the beads lack any product logo, where I can determine whether it is true or false, The picture did not remove the side details, the side details and the main style are inconsistent, there is a significant difference, so this is one.
When purchasing, especially from Hong Kong, exercise caution.
Customer support on Amazon is atrocious
I ordered something two days ago, and when I got it today, the price had been dropped by 40 yuan, It took me a while to locate customer support, but once I did, they told me that since I couldn't make up the difference, I could repurchase the item and return it.
Actually, this kind of customer care and experience is 10,000 times worse than that of a particular treasure.
Okay, for a beginner, it's worth purchasing
While not on par with the best King Kong, the quality is respectable, I've seen the pricing in the mall before; it's at least several hundred, King Kong is my first game, and I like it.
Nice things
The item is excellent, and I presented it to my girlfriend, However, I was disappointed that I couldn't receive the quick delivery because I wasn't in Canada at noon, I had to run twice since the shipping company dropped the mail right in the treasure and did not send me a text message to confirm that I could pick up the box.
The baby though is excellent.
Worth purchasing
The small monkey is adorable, and Amazon has excellent savings, the products are shipped directly from the Chow Sang Sang official website, I ordered it the previous evening, and I got it this afternoon, Really quickly.
The mail messenger was likewise quite responsible.
Praise!
A client's admission
1 Amazon customer support advises you to not worry if you receive a product with such an issue… we will get in touch with you in around 54 hours.
2 You then get in touch with the customer service team in the middle, who will let you know that a professional will handle this issue, and let you know the outcome.
Since you don't know the commissioner's job number and there isn't a direct phone number to call, you'll never make the effort to get in touch with her, She is the only one who can reach you, You can't.
3 The tragedy is that I just heard from the commissioner after waiting for almost 3 days, I left my phone unattended for a bit, but the commissioner didn't call.
After 2 hours of waiting, the specialist did not call, I made the decision to email Amazon customer support during this time to request a callback, I also took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service.
4 I still don't know what Amazon will do with the faulty coffee maker I received after almost 3 days have passed!
5 In the United States, there are no issues with Amazon's items, although the foreign purchasing process is good, it is still significantly inferior to the service in the United States and Asia.
6 I must simply continue to wait...
Irregular bottom
Everyone is anticipating this pot because of the positive comments, When I first got it, I really liked it, although it is quite lightweight, there was an issue when I opened the pot, the pot's bottom is not perfectly flat, the oil has spread to the edges if it has sunk, Large, fatty meat that was particularly purchased is fried in so much oil that it cannot cover the entire surface of the pot.
I'm not sure if I merely received a pot with a poor foundation out of luck, Fortunately Amazon offers a 30-day return policy, so I firmly returned it.
I spent a lot of time working in vain as I scrubbed the pot clean before returning it.
To accomplish good product design, manufacturing processes must be compatible
This product has a fairly straightforward design.
The top of the cube was designed as a slightly curved surface by the designer.
The lines ought to have been very slick.
Unfortunately, the intended outcome was not realized.
Since the top is divided into two halves, the control panel is on the front and the top cover for the water tank is on the back.
When combined, there is a height variation of up to 2mm between the top cover's and the control panel's curvatures, which are truly inconsistent.
despite appearing to be a modest opening.
However, one could argue that the entire sense of design has been lost.
The product designer is in my sympathy.
It appears that the product managers at Midea are still unable to produce goods of this caliber.
(Of course, I can't expect too much from the after-sales representative, but when I heard her say that not just the product I purchased has issues, but all individuals who use it do as well, I realized that you can't expect too much from Midea), The water pump stopped working on July 7, 2019, and there was little water output, following the second repair, which was made two weeks following the first, it broke once more.
Extremely nice bargain after the deal, extremely unhappy Amazon false offer
The insulation is very sturdy and was bought a week after the baby was delivered.
Even if you are not concerned about getting burned, there is no sign of heat on the outside of the pot, which successfully keeps the heat from escaping.
Even after a night, the air-conditioned space can continue to keep a high temperature.
According to Amazon, the anniversary event will include 320 significant discounts, I discovered afterwards that everyone had 249, 289, and 299, I immediately felt duped, so I went to the grocery store and made a comparison.
Vitamix Vitamix 6300
I've been waiting and watching for a while, and now that I've seen that Meiya 6300 is on discount and that orders made outside of Central Asia are priced similarly, I urge you to act quickly.
My order, which I placed on September 2, was supposed to arrive on the 21st, but it did so on the 12th instead—nearly 10 days earlier—so the speed is really quick!
Amazon is not worried, about breaking the Vitamix original packaging when it is hurled across the ocean, because the packaging box is not large and is being utilized directly!
Although the machine appears to be brand-new and has all the necessary components, the cup shakes so violently on the base that I am frightened it may fly out when the machine is switched on!
When I asked a buddy who also had a 5200, he said that his was not as loose as mine.
The recipes that come with it are all in English, which can be a nuisance to understand, and there isn't a Chinese translation online, so that's another inconvenience!
I purchased a transformer as soon as the items were delivered, It's expected to arrive in 3 days, at which point I'll throw it away!
The material is average, the size is very little, and there is no umbrella cover.
Absolutely not a queen size!
The subsequent Totes, 1. There is no umbrella cover on this one 2. The umbrella handle's material is ordinary 3. Despite the fact that it is labeled as Large, this umbrella is actually practical for one person, For two people, that probably isn't enough.
The one I previously purchased in the United States of America, on the other hand, can be comfortably utilized by three people.
It's not a good sensation
First of all, the box is not very sturdy, with the addition of a press on the deformation, then the design of the flat rear of the box to prevent the ABS surface from scratching and fails, and lastly, the box is again cloth-wrapped inside, where the trolley bar protrudes.. And so on, there are numerous sources of unhappiness, and eventually, the zipper is not quite smooth.
PS: The wheels are really comfortable
Reasonably good
Benefits: This bag is more delicate, and appears to be more robust.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot fit (it could be a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but there is no lock for the customer, and it cannot be described as service-oriented.
Overall it's ok, although I'm not sure if the leather is real
Not terrible, all things considered, I am unable to make a blind judgment because I am unsure if it is real leather.
A box-shaped object that is too thick and hard (not malleable) might not be able to fit inside of it, though it can accommodate A4-sized documents, even ones with a thickness of more than 80 pages.
The inner bag divider is more user-friendly, and the bag is very soft, both of which are excellent qualities.
I recently found a small sand hole at the bottom of this, I'm not sure if my lousy character is to blame or not?
Don't complain, too lazy to toss the products back and forth.
Overall, it merits four stars.
ForRoyal is well-known worldwide for their camera straps and SLR straps
In contrast to other fast gunners, which use screws to fix the bottom to harm the camera, this strap is more scientifically constructed, hanging from the shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected with soft material, It is also extremely easy to remove the camera from this strap.
Poor post-purchase support
One of the parts on the piano I bought a month and a half ago was missing, they provided me with an after-sales phone number after alerting Amazon, the part has not yet been received despite numerous communications, what class of effectiveness is this!
If an issue arises in the future, it is anticipated that it will be more difficult to fix, the after-sales service is too much bother, so friends who are looking forward to it should take a detour!
Little faults, excellent sound
The headstock is flawed, there is a missing corner, it feels like a flawed product, and there are no extras, but the price is reasonable and the piano sounds great.
The initial face sheet is alright, so
Though the bass does not come through, other than that, it has been in use for a while, and the entirety is not poor.
just that the workmanship falls short of expectations.
When I first purchased it, there was a problem, all of the lights were flickering, and it was inoperable.
Although I requested a replacement, it took the items three days to reach Shanghai and they have still not been delivered.
The delivery person is unresponsive to calls.
The courier service claimed to have only that one contact.
Amazon is unable to lodge a complaint anywhere.
The delivery was delayed at my request, even though there was no request for it to be done - a text message confirming this appeared.
About the transit issue, I'll speak later.
Anyway, the incredibly bad purchasing experience led me to start questioning the efficiency of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I suppose I won't be able to collect it today.
Label adhesion is inadequate and not watertight
The printed content is not waterproof, the surface is not covered, and the label is highly sticky, making it unsuitable for cable labeling and very easy to come off, even if the Bluetooth connection is quite convenient, Friends who purchase it to manage wires ought to click pay attention.
The pen is fine, but the packaging is overly plain, consisting of only a cardboard box with no safety measures, and the pen box is glued, with a large piece of transparent glue, which is all over the box when it is taken off.
This is how the 600 yuan item is handled, which is a very unsatisfactory purchase.
However, the pen works just fine.
Hopefully, future packaging improvements will be made!
The caliber is subpar, It is inferior to 925-25, if the topic is writing
First off, kudos to the Daily Express, air components, delivered incredibly quickly, also excellent customer care!
I've been utilizing 925-25, which is excellent, I recently got 925-85, The pen is of outstanding quality, and it also has a stunning aesthetic, the pen is a bit hefty and not suited for writing quickly, which is why I only rated it four stars, the lead length can be altered by the cap, 925-25 is smoother than 85, in my perspective, therefore, the place is a little shaky.
Therefore becoming a devoted fan of Amazon
Even though I got it for a steep discount, the kid didn't enjoy the reading pen.
It has been opened, and when I attempted to request a return, it was picked up at no cost to me.
Too amazing.
Although returns are not advised, this service is the only one offered in China.
It shouldn't be misused, I hope.
Future books will now be available for purchase here.
Noises can be heard and the headphones are crooked
This headset is absolutely terrible, I'm not sure if my ears are off or if it's just that it's not as excellent as it once was.
Two years ago, I purchased a blue one from Xyiyi, there is no noise, and the sound quality is not awful, the bass is quite decent, I intend to purchase another one (urbeats) after using this one for more than two years, After all, it feels fantastic.
I also saw one in purple that was quite attractive, but when I bought this one and opened it today, I got the strangest feeling.
I initially assumed it was just the song's sound effect and didn't give it much attention, but after giving it a lot of time I realized the issue was quite significant, the bass effect was not as good as my prior one, in addition to the pitch deviation, additionally, there was some noise, has the purple one I purchased had this phenomenon? Or is the current earphone manufacturing method ineffective?
Rating pretty bad, very disappointed.
It has to be delivered back tomorrow during the day.
PS appears fine
This AV power amplifier has difficult settings, a rough exterior, and produces a lot of heat.
Before making a remark, sound should be used for some time!
On August 14, I only recently acquired the German version of DN1080. I observed shoddy workmanship.
1. The knobs and front panel are both composed of plastic.
2. The speaker output connector and the audio input connection on the back panel are both quite subpar, simply locate a 1000–2000 CD power amplifier all–in–one device, it is far superior to this one.
3. The side of my transformer was buried, and the top cover is comparatively thin, It needed to be manually opened up and restored, the top cover and front panel were not tightly fastened together.
4. The machine as a whole has a biased center of gravity toward the transformer end, which makes it difficult to move.
It has the impression of being a basic Sony device that was only produced in Malaysia.
In my opinion Sony would fare better as an OEM in China than Xiaoma.
5. The machine produces a lot of heat, and when you touch the top cover of the two-channel movie for around 2 hours, it's between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius, I'm not sure if the transformer produces a lot of heat or if it's just too big.
The majority of power supplies used today are switching power supplies, and this ridiculously huge transformer weighs approximately 4KG.
Sony needs to utilize a fan that actively removes heat from the device while remaining silent, Only the sizable aluminum heat sink on the tube is visible after the package has been opened.

Never been opened
The battery is working.
I really want to dissect it and see what is in its stomach.
If you think about it afterwards, It would be unreasonable to spend that much money if you were unhappy after disassembling it; on the other hand, if you were satisfied after disassembling it, it would be challenging to rebuild and uncomfortable to use.
Even though Sony is employing a quality battery cell, forget it.
The majority of individuals will feel guilty after reading the in-depth description of the power.
Fortunately, I have extensive experience working in a manufacturing producing mobile phones, I can be considered to be a half-battery engineer, and I can handle it, aside from the fact that I don't comprehend circuits.
Delighted with the outcome
I was pretty apprehensive before I bought it, but after I cracked open the box, I was certain!
The headphone cable was incredibly flexible and of such high quality that when I finally touched it, I couldn't wait to connect it to my phone and launch QQ Music.
I was astounded to discover that the sound quality was surround 3D!
I inquired in the actual communication store and was told that it would be around 30 or so, but it is unmistakably not the Pinsent Masons brand; instead, it is a different brand, so even if this Pinsent Masons is 27 yuan, it is well worth the money!
Worst experience with online purchasing
The system said that the order had been dispatched after it was placed on September 28, but the products weren't received until October 12.
Look at the Amazon order status, the vendor did not include an express tracking number, thus I am unable to determine the location of the order.
So I emailed the vendor to ask whether I could share the tracking number, but after two days there was still no response.
I dialed Amazon customer support out of desperation, the seller's mobile phone number was provided by customer support, I dialed the shop once more.
Despite my intense rage, I didn't say much to the seller and simply asked for them to deliver the computer over right away because I needed it so badly.
I called the following day to inquire as a result: Has it been shipped?
Not yet, according to the vendor; it will be available in the afternoon.
The seller told me it will be delivered after five or six in the afternoon when I called again in the afternoon, but when I called at seven in the evening, nobody picked up.
I contacted once more on the morning of the third day and enquired as to whether the things had been dispatched?
Could you let me know the order number?
The vendor claimed he didn't ship it and advised me to get it from another store if I needed it right away, If I could wait, he said, I could send it in the afternoon.
No way, placing an order from another store takes a lot of time.
Just request rapid shipping from the seller.
On October 16th, finally, after numerous phone calls, I got the computer.
I don't know the computer's quality because I purchased it for someone else, but I will post remarks later.
It has a horrible contact presently, despite the fact that I've only had it for six months and haven't used it much, Can I have it fixed?
Since I acquired it, I've occasionally not used it because I have a desktop computer.
I only keep it in my work bag and occasionally utilize it.
Recently, it was discovered that it was not charging when the power was turned on, To charge it, you had to repeatedly hold the charger's cable connection in place with your hands.
The interface may not be connected properly, according to speculation, can it be fixed right now, I wonder?
It is highly advised that Amazon turn off EMS!
Three-star average, one-star logistics, five-star product.
Why Amazon wants to dispatch EMS is a mystery to me, its unreliability is acknowledged in the sector, computers are, in any case, valuable!
The family waited at home for three days after placing the order, which states that delivery is anticipated for the 20th!
Why does sending it from Xiamen to Fuzhou take four or five days!
I verified the logistics early on February 22nd and eventually made it to Fuzhou, I was happy and prepared to accept the gifts, So without getting any calls or texts, I reviewed the logistics at night!
I was startled right away!
My identity? My location? Have I truly purchased this computer?
Just questioned life, okay!
Finally, I returned the machine to the collecting location.
The item is fortunately not lost, but specifically because the courier brother just switched the two tracking numbers.
I firmly advise Amazon not to employ EMS, I won't buy it again from Amazon if they start using EMS for rapid shipping in the future.
The products are not of poor quality
First and foremost, I purchased it a few days ago and discovered that the price had been dropped, the book is not bad, but the price is exorbitant, the CPU and graphics card are sufficient for most online games and a few huge single computers, the heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a bit light leaking (IPS screen) (Common problems), the audio quality is not very good, and the hard disk is not very good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state), I took it to the after-sales service yesterday to test the hardware, no problem, the built-in win8.1 is not very easy to use, It is recommended to upgrade to 10, The merchant delivered the goods immediately and responded to all inquiries promptly, after obtaining the PC, the invoice arrived the following day, not terrible, but there are no gifts unfortunately.
(By the way, you should not buy keyboard film from a store called E Cool Digital Center in a certain treasure, Delivery is sluggish, and the quality is subpar, the product will not be returned or exchanged if there is an issue with it, the boss is full of curses, allow me to disclose it)
The content is excellent, the platform bureaucrats persist
The hard disk's quality is excellent, and the price/performance ratio is excellent, It is less expensive than purchasing in Hong Kong, It is strongly advised to purchase if you are not in a hurry and can tolerate the logistics.
But I must remark that the Amazon platform's bureaucracy remains unchanged, it hasn't improved since I said I'd never use it again a couple years ago, you will never learn the true logistical situation, you can never complain because the information is always supplied after a few weeks, that's all there is to it: bureaucracy!
It has been a few days after the items were received, and the logistics information indicates that you will receive the goods in 10 days!
Logistics are not cost effective
When it was delivered in this manner, not only was the packaging flattened, but the packaging of electrical appliances was also opened, I'm not sure if there has been a package update.
FYI
I haven't used it yet, but I always trust Philips, so I'm hoping the battery life is longer than that of other brands.
I looked it up online, and it appears to be a regular issue with water ingress, with no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrapped in plastic wrap to be used again, I'm not sure how long it can be used for?
Purchase the unwrapped products of others
It is true that a machine costing more than three hundred will pay a tax of over one hundred, observing that it is now over six hundred and so more balanced.
The sealing tape was in very poor shape when I got it, looking like it had been disassembled, I snapped a quick photo, and sure enough, it opened as soon as it was taken off, The cardboard inside was still harmed after being opened, I was concerned that someone else might have returned it, I soon tried it on my spouse on the anniversary, but there was no electricity at all in the machine, fortunately, the cutter head doesn't include any beard stubble, so why not send it back completely?
It is unknown if there will be any immediate issues or if it will be simple to use, the items sent out while they are out of stock are highly unreliable, same as the previous review!
Intermediate to advanced level of experience
There are numerous cleaning modes on this virtually premium electric, but few users will switch their brushes between settings every day.
It has been used for six months now without any issues, I've been brushing and flushing it every day for more than 1 week.
On Amazon, brush head accessories are equally affordable.
Except for changing the color, what other ostensibly compatible flaws making the application a little challenging to use are the causes of the international release?
I'd like to study from Dafa.
very economical
I've used it 3-4 times.
1, The packing is undamaged.
2, It is incredibly simple to use and clean.
3, Saving money by DIY-ing your haircut is entirely achievable.
An excellent purchase, all around.
There are imitations
When I most recently purchased two packs, there were actually two distinct models, initially, the lettering on the pack's lower left corner were green, but it turned out that one pack didn't have green words and had white ones instead, after consuming it, the cat experienced diarrhea as a result.
I'm not sure, if the product source on Amazon is phony, or if a delivery worker switched it.
I will purchase it again, and if it's still a forgery, I'll find you the appropriate individuals to hold it accountable.
A horizontal bar is what it is!
Although the Amazon image has cuts, the effect is a horizontal cut, isn't it a lie?
The outcome is not poor
The idea is that, cats enjoy eating.
And it is effective.
Instep grinding, hoop feet, and tight, tiny spaces.
Not suggested.
1. Clarks' UN series is the most comfy, but this particular model is awful.
Addition: Today I compared the previous UN series insoles (throw away the shoes and save the insoles), and I found that the material is significantly worse than before, the elasticity is lower, and the breathability is lower, it is also counterfeit and soft.
2. My instep is not very high, and the cruciate section is located around 3 cm in front of the instep's highest point.
3. Only one pair of the three pairs of Clarks I purchased abroad fits.
I erased all of the music from my favorites because I was so terrified.
If Rockport doesn't work, try it again, otherwise you may only visit an actual Ecco store.
Inadequate, poor quality control
First of all, it is important to stress the strength of Ups' Prime foreign purchasing, which enabled the order to be placed on the 31st and be delivered on the 6th.
The shoe color is much more vibrant in reality than in the photo, and the leather is comfortable.
The shoe size is slightly larger, measuring 25 feet long, 10.5 broad, and 7.5W, the upper foot is a touch loose, but I often prefer to wear looser shoes, and a pair of insoles are perfect.
Second, this shoe's quality control is actually not admirable, the rubber on one sole has been damaged, while the other sole's upper has numerous scratches and a pinhole, the rubber strip between the top and the sole is not where it should be!
I sort of regret it!
I paid 280 yuan for it for an event, purchasing ASICS at this pricing is a steal, of course, lower pricing can be found in the comments.
Let us now discuss the shoes, Advantages: The sneakers are incredibly light, pleasant for jogging, and fit nicely without being baggy.
The aesthetic is excellent, but there are some evident drawbacks: I typically wear 40 shoes, but I bought 40.5 shoes this time, and there is roughly 1 thumb's gap from the front of the shoes, but this makes no difference.
This shoe is incredibly "narrow," and despite the fact that there is still some space in the front, it feels tight.
Another point to consider is that the shoes may not be adequately ventilated, and it feels hot to wear them right now.
Putting pressure on the instep
First and foremost, the shoes' craftsmanship is excellent, and they are well worth the price.
My feet are pretty standard type, running shoes UK7.5, EU41.5, leather shoes UK6.5, Amazon's Aibu also bought a few pairs, there has never been an ill-fitting pair , but for this pair, I referred to the remarks and bought a freshman Size UK7, the length of the upper foot is plainly longer because it is one size larger, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses the rear of the foot very hard, and the hiking shoes are quite harsh, making the top of the foot very uncomfortable.
It is not recommended that you acquire this if your feet are not extremely thin.
You can change the insole if you have to buy it, but the original insole looks really high-end, so it's a shame not to use it.
A fantastic buying experience!
I'm quite pleased with it and enjoy it a lot, there is little doubt that Amazon's overseas purchases are genuine, and the quality is excellent, it is of great quality and reasonably priced, you can be confident that you will be able to purchase it, he after-sales service is excellent, the rapid delivery service is really convenient and secure, and the delivery master is highly mindful to consumers, He will remind you to pick up the things from the express cabinet on schedule every time, thank you Amazon for making shopping so enjoyable for your customers.
Overall, our entire family enjoys buying on Amazon from abroad!
Definitely a poor review!
As it relates to this agency and Amazon, I am truly stunned.
Future electronic product purchases on Amazon should be cautious.
I still want to voice my displeasure even if it's been a while.
I paid less than 200 for it in winter spikes, but keeping it at home for a few months is pointless.
I discovered that I couldn't connect to the bracelet when I attempted to use it in the spring, the user manuals for both devices endorsed one another, later I discovered that since I was still having trouble connecting to other devices, the issue should have been with the heart rate band.
I called Amazon and requested them to put me in touch with the agency, who told me to pay for the shipping of the equipment to Shanghai for testing.
The items were sent back undamaged after almost half a month, even the express box I used to send them over was there!
There is no response, acknowledgement or test report!
Tell me at least whether it's nice or awful!
When I contacted to inquire, I was informed that sending it back in this manner indicates there is no issue with the apparatus, which is good.
The agency responded, "That's not their business," when I asked why I still can't connect.
I'm unfortunate because I'm too lazy to be hurled by you for 200 yuan stuff.
Definitely incorrect merchandise.
Extremely low stock.
Excellent material for the headband.
Much more superior than Nike.
Breathability is excellent as well.
Only the front cap.
Extremely fine.
Are you just here for fun? !
There is absolutely no sunlight.
It is not being returned because it makes a good headband.
Even if it doesn't block the sun, wear it upward.
Nevertheless, distinct from other headband designs.
For future use, keep it.
The products are of decent quality, Amazon doesn't uphold its end of the bargain, and the delivery person is excellent.
I want my package delivered on Saturday and Sunday!
Delivery on Saturday and Sunday is not permitted by Amazon's policies.
Caused me to travel 200 kilometers from the field to pick up the supplies!
How am I supposed to love you again, Amazon?
The individual who delivered the package was upbeat and enthusiastic.
Make a public announcement!
Commodities, just tried it, and it's not awful.
However, because I have never purchased identical things, I am unable to compare pricing!
Dimensional Logistics
The craftsmanship is good, but the logistics are too slow, the preceding shoes were all sent via DHL, Apex is truly... this time, I bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not cheap, isn't the grade greater than NIKE and ADIDAS?
They are actually all the same, so international shopping.
I am 68KG and 176CM tall, 180 is normally how wide my shoulders are, the hem on the M that I purchased is a little longer, others fit perfectly, I see that the S size is advised, Are you really so thin? Or would you rather a snug fit? A loose hoodie, in my opinion, is preferable.
The perfect size
With a bust size of 99, a height of 184, and a weight of 84 kg, I was advised to get a XXL by customer care before making my purchase, however after reading customer evaluations, I chose to purchase an L, after receiving the item, I discovered that the size was perfect, and I was almost tricked.
Black Friday is substantially cheaper than Double Eleven in terms of price.
The clothing is of excellent quality.
Z inexpensive goods issue is problematic!
On the 18th, the order was placed, and the products arrived on the 25th, from Guangzhou to Beijing, the speed is that of a snail!
I purchased Z’s least expensive item, and the description stated that there were scratches, but when I received the item, I discovered that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The kid didn't want to return the item because he didn't believe it was a big deal, but when the kid's grandfather raced to several nearby hardware stores, he was unable to find such tiny accessories!
Grandpa finally cemented it in place!
Looks like I won't be purchasing Z's reasonably priced stuff in the future!
Poor manufacturing quality for toys
The majority of the bolt holes are out of alignment, making it difficult to put the bolts, the processing quality is poor, as can be observed, and I'm not sure how long it can be played, it will not be returned because the child was promised it in the first place.
Is there a problem with just the one I got when other reviews claim that installation is not difficult?
Extremely average
Is it my misfortune?
The packaging is dated, the workmanship is mediocre, there is just one type of music that lasts for only 8 seconds before being replayed, and the action is to shake the head and go on in the same direction with no deviation.
Cost is not justified.
Immediately use, not for product return.
Although the toy is of good quality, I must criticize the packing
Yesterday, the courier arrived, I ordered it from Amazon, It has an EMS delivery label on it, in the end, a courier from Tmall brought it, how many turns were required? Do Amazon and Tmall still have a good relationship?
Let's talk about the packaging once more, it's just wrapped in plastic wrap for a few layers, not even a package of plastic bubble wrap inside, when you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box, fortunately the quality of the toy is good, no broken parts, however, it is much smaller than expected because it is not battery-operated, and it frequently derails when being pushed by hand, I feel that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, and the spacing between the wheels is too wide.
High caliber and enjoyable
It is a lot of fun, the parts are extremely precise, the craftsmanship is excellent, the quality is comparable to Lego, and the price is extremely advantageous when engaging in activities.
Putting everything together is a fascinating process, my 5 year old son will join me in playing if I do it, very well done.
He laughed and marveled while he played ~ will probably keep purchasing toys from this manufacturer.
The device is new, and international shopping is good
For Christmas, I took a look at it, the one I previously purchased cost 150 yuan more, but the shipping is now a little slower.
The equipment is still in fantastic shape and is very new.
Integrated Pikachu.
After that, if you link the genie ball, a fantasy will be sent.
It's more portable than a PS4 and not horrible to play.
Zelda was already purchased, wait for the game, then play.
This was the outcome of the production of defective goods, sale of defective goods, and service of defective goods, six timepieces were purchased to be given to the children, but one of them showed partial numerals, and the time on all six watches varied by more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if there was a time check on the watch in the warehouse, they replied "yes", since there is, so then why is the time difference so much? That must be because the watch is not accurate, simply put, it is a water product, not what I said, look well, as there are very obvious quality problems (digital display is not complete) and are taken out to sell, are not junk goods.
I got in touch with the vendor, who gave me a long list of excuses for why I shouldn't have bought their goods and lamented that no one would ever dare to purchase anything from them in the future on Amazon with such products, sellers, and after-sales service.
To put it briefly, I advise against purchasing anything from this seller because it is also junk.
Shipping issues with Amazon
After receiving the products, investigation showed that:
1, The table packaging is severely deteriorated.
2, The watch's instruction manual has significant use wrinkles.
3, Because the watch does not function and the desk lamp is not used to charge it, the time cannot be altered.
4, Contact Amazon customer support individually, and you can only mail to the United States at your own expense, with postage reimbursed later.
5, 2 points because customer service is not subpar.
All I can say is that it isn't bad
Only a few months have seen speeds more than two minutes, and time is not very accurate, moving forward by around a second per day.
I've used Citizen previously, and I believe that it won't lag behind by a few seconds in a year or two.
While the timing function is a bit bland and hardly ever utilized, the perpetual calendar function is pretty wonderful, on occasion, it will unintentionally switch to timing mode.
solar-powered sports watch
Benefits: world time, a variety of alarms, and full point reminders, solar charging eliminates the need to worry about replacing the battery.
Shortcomings: The mirror surface is vulnerable to dust buildup and scratches.
Value for money: While it costs, on average, between 220 and 300 in China, it may be acquired for more than 180 abroad (with about 1 week).
Very pleased with the watch
It has to be genuine, I went to the desk to inspect the merchandise, the watch has a lovely aesthetic, superb craftsmanship, adequate materials, and an imported mechanical movement, so it has weight, those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches are inoperable, by the way, this is the real deal.
The watch's trip time is extremely accurate, and its error is entirely within acceptable bounds, the 12 on the dial is a genuine diamond, and a certificate of jewelry appraisal is included with the watch, both as a present and as something you may wear by yourself, this is excellent.
The timepieces made by Bentley are excellent.
One of the worst buying experiences I've ever had
My wife dropped her phone on the night of September 23rd, I ordered an 8p from Amazon on the spur of the moment, It was available, but it was not self-operated, and there was no price increase (I was secretly relieved), because non-self-operated delivery is relatively delayed, the system indicates that it is expected to be the most recent, the delivery date is September 27th.
My wife felt really uncomfortable with the absence of a mobile phone, I was requested to come up with a solution the next morning at 6:00 am Later, I returned to Jingdong and saw that the 256G was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I ordered another one right away.
I planned to cancel the Amazon order as soon as I purchased the new one.
Because the order was placed in the middle of the night, the courier could not arrive in the early morning, I called customer service after 7 o'clock and requested that the order be cancelled, the customer support representative said that it has been canceled, and to wait for the SMS message.
So I simply waited patiently, when I checked my phone at midday, the order was still in the status and had not been delivered, I immediately contacted the customer service and requested that the order be canceled as quickly as possible, customer service responded that the operation was well.
I checked the order on my phone at 3:00 pm and saw that it was still there, I had no alternative but to contact the customer support again to inform them that this was the third call, please cancel the order and notify the seller that it will not be shipped!
At my request, customer support contacted the seller on the spot and informed me that the seller is unfamiliar with the system and will cancel the order once he becomes acquainted with it.
But please reassure me that the seller is aware and will never ship if you can.
I was in awe when I noticed that the purchase had already been dispatched when I checked the order display on Monday.
I can only phone customer service since I can't get in touch with the merchant directly.
After that, I'm just at a loss for words, in essence, I say do this action, and customer service will continue to operate.
The order is getting ready to send it again and is currently still in the delivery refusal phase!
Wouldn't Amazon go out of their way to follow up?
It makes no difference if the seller's company has already collected the money and does not follow up.
To summarize, there will never again be prepayment for huge products, this is really too bothersome.
Good looking
This camera has long since captured my heart, but I have refrained from purchasing it for reasons other than the cost, this time, I purchased it because it came with free shipping and the pricing was reasonable.
Other things were fine once I got it, but when the program was connected, I was unable to connect, a TP router is at my house, I discovered after searching the Internet that this issue affects a lot of people, more than two hours later, I made several adjustments, in the end, I configured the router using 360WIFI as the medium, during that time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have an answer for this issue, they merely instructed me to get in touch with Amazon for customer support.
A further aspect worth mentioning is that, according to user comments I read online, the least memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and memory cards with a smaller storage capacity cannot be detected, I hope everyone is paying attention to this.
It's comfortable to use, the picture is good, but the sound quality is bad and the machine gets hot, if it is always switched on, it feels as if this level of heat is intolerable.
To summarize, this product still has numerous flaws, and I hope you would be cautious while purchasing it.
Due to the fact that I purchased it with my first love in my life, I gave it 3 stars, after almost 3 years of dating, he abruptly broke up with me last year and has not returned.
I gave it 3 stars since I bought it with my first love in my life and now I'm not sure how much I've used it, so maybe toss it away!
Almost 3 years of romance, so she left me last year, and now when I think of her, I want to quit the world, the first lady in my life, given me a lifetime of darkness and pain, and I have not been able to get out of it so far.
I considered how the two felt at the time I got this cell phone, I could still join in their pleasures and sufferings, but I am unable to do so at this time, perhaps this is how life is, some people don't want to meet in their lifetime, and some things don't want to know in their lifetime, but what can be done?
How many times have I seen a Samsung mobile phone and thought about her, and the agony has filled my entire body? I was never willing to use a phone worth more than 2,000 yuan, but I didn't hesitate when I bought it for her, no matter how nice you are to someone, when she changes her mind one day, all the promises will disappear.
The top national brands
Huawei is the best of national products.
Unlike the current corporate climate, which depends on promotion to grow popularity, low-key CEOs and businesses win clients through technology and quality!
This is difficult for a corporation lacking in strength, and it would be foolish to attempt it!
I decided on Huawei because of this.
Since I purchased it more than six months ago, it continues to feel excellent all the time, very good.
It was fine, but I didn't give it a perfect score because there was a non-location occurrence once when I was using its offline navigation, and I never did figure out why.
Additionally, it has entered the destination online and, after searching, creates the route automatically, after disconnecting from the Wi-Fi, its automated offline navigation feature is very helpful since it instantly communicates with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation without having to navigate through traffic, which is excellent!
Sony's great approach is effective
Sony's entry-level phone still has a solid sense of design, is reasonably priced, has a sizable screen, and has exceptional battery life, the elderly will benefit much from it.
Even though time has gone, this machine is still in perfect working order.
But as my Z2 is decentralized, this phone's task has also been accomplished.
