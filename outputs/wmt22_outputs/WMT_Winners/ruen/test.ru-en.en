From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac's age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torment of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting for teenagers.
In general, teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to represent a particular variety?
There are roses of this color and with this petal structure, reminiscent of velvet, usually dark red, burgundy tones.
And light roses look different, the petals have just a satin or silky shine.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 mattress.
Micropackage Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness of the sides: a medium-hard surface is formed by latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, and a moderately soft one by a slab of natural latex.
The spring unit with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight the breathable materials.
The latex, perforated for breathability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is the coir of the coconut.
This preserves the healthy microclimate of the bed.
The mattress is also covered by an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but in reality the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover, which is included in the set.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow to pair with the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.
Switch on your brain and chase such relatives together!

Andrei, it was clearly explained to you that retired women work in schools, they will not work on the command line.
The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, they didn't teach him this, the school plays games on Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember these feasts and guests at my parents' house with horror.
The guests are on the doorstep, but the meatballs are still cooking on the stove, and my mother is still washing the floor.
My God, I sat down at the table already exhausted.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you haul groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They feel good, and they always take a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays or guests.
Even for my family, I set the table at a minimum.
And I cook them yakitori, I bake them very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine is imminent
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the last, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite Germany's aggressive vaccination campaign, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
Die Welt reports about this on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of coronavirus "Omicron."
And the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omikron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Omicron coronavirus variant.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are pushing to speed up the pace of vaccinations in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel very convincingly shows this," the expert stressed.
Pontoon21 Wobbler, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with ice fishing in mind, and not just for casting.
These vibes have a greater specific weight than their close-in-size counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and resilient plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe," Bet-A-Vib shows a rather aggressive game when fishing in the plumb.
Simple monotonous animation is often the most effective, that is, the movement of the fishing rod up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for winter walleye and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when pinpoint and aggressive bait feeding is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib has also been used with equal success for winter pond trout fishing.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to tease a passive pike, which does not react even to a live bait, with a plumb game.
When fishing, the Bet-A-Vib cast demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is clear and not capricious, goes well with fishing line and braided cords, even of large diameters.
For catching pike, zander, ruff or perch, in addition to a uniform cast, a "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "chirp" along the bottom.
If you're fishing in congested areas, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of snagging.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most effective.
It can be used with equal success both in relatively shallow and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers are sitting on the necks of their elderly parents.

In Libya, they announced 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the Wagner PMC in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at the Ghardabiya airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu Agency quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "putting their man in power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the air base and port in Sirte, as well as the air base in Jufra, the agency's publication notes.
The Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed either in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the form lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
Libya's Supreme State Council is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions with Islamists dominating it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the election of members of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"The elections are less than two weeks away, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this backdrop, Libya's Supreme Electoral Commission has indefinitely postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
"Examples of success - "we protected Syria and restored peace there," "the decision on Nord Stream 2," "we intimidated the whole world that cool weapons," "we squeezed Crimea."
The main failures are the "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper paperwork - all public services have also become digital only
The government of Dubai announced a complete abandonment of paper records and a transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," the emirate's crown prince, chairman of Dubai's executive council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, said on Saturday.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitalization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities calculated, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, it's already senile, about the class and group in kindergarten, too.
Well, I don't believe that such stretch marks exist.
And if they do, they clearly don't care about anything, including their families.
My mother, her two brothers and my grandfather and grandmother lived on 3 Vladimirskaya, the first floor had no bars.
They first knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to stand on ceremony, broke the window and got in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the performance of the industry for the first 11 months was worse than last year's result, reports Bloomberg, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115 thousand cars were produced in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year's figure.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector in Turkey showed positive dynamics compared to last year, then, according to the results of the first 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral on loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform" reports.
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, pursuant to the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On approval of the Procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans to small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted," wrote Alikhan Smailov in his response to the deputy's inquiry.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferral of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
In the borrower's application, a different period of deferred payments could have been specified.
During the deferral period, the claim and claim work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended in relation to the borrower, "the deputy prime minister noted.
For 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferral of loan payments from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SME entities received deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
In MFIs, 131 SME entities applied for deferral, of which deferral was granted to 95 entities in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryaev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the "okmiron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those with a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryaev explained why the "okmiron" strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason is to be found in the conditions of the virus's origin.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, with the mutation, he did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Due to this, it is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, he may have more of these spike proteins, spikes, than expected, their antibodies were not truncated during mutations, comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryaev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "okmiron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-old young people die, and 60-year-old olds tolerate it in the form of sneezing.
The immune response of a young person is frantic, it is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to wag a finger, it hits like a cannon at sparrows, concluded Sergei Puryaev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to stop only the symptoms - all hope is in the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, Russia may start vaccinating the younger generation between the ages of 12 and 18 before the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the laboratory of genomic engineering at MIPT, noted that this category is very actively affected by Covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the highest number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, just like kindergarten pupils, said Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering at MIPT, to "Moscow 24."
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
It was a pleasure to refresh memories...
Teath-In.
Back in the seventies and eighties, no dance floor was complete without the group's tunes.
And at home, getting together with friends, they danced to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why obese people fall victim to Covid
The authors of the work studied adipose tissue remaining from bariatric operations and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died from Covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to evade the immune system's response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably also capable of this.
Biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty navigating even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by bad habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, he was a professor at the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FSUE HE RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the cognitive impairment department at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return home about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the air of the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of the ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gowad specified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Department officials are now working to return them to Egypt.
In particular, experts "monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally taken in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities that were illegally exported from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by "black diggers."
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse has not commented on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego."
It is no longer part of any literary associations, it has spilled over with imagism, it is on its own, but it is known, in demand, at times severely criticized by critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to carry it in its arms.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia."
And the main success - at the end of June 25, the State Publishing House signed an agreement with Yesenin to publish his works in 3 volumes.
None of Sergei Alexandrovich's contemporary poets have received such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
The funds were needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, Sophia Tolstoy, and it was necessary to arrange the family life, to support his sisters, Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life is getting better, there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is painted mostly in dark colors, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is that the wind whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
So, like a grove in September,
Alcohol floods the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had lost a lot of weight, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
Revelry and nervous breakdowns are becoming more frequent.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, relating to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, improved his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin would visit him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's drinking binges, scandals on this basis, drives to the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 1920s, the poet's terrible love affair with the green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin stayed for a short time with a friend, the Imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own home either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found it in rented apartments, in hotels or with acquaintances.
Starcev recalls:
"I only came to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunken state.
One day, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
When he fell, he scratched his face and wheezed.
After regaining consciousness, he began to cough incessantly, spraying the entire sheet with blood..."
And Yesenin himself, after a trip to Europe and the USA (there was a dry law in the States at that time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I'm almost at the end and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, and drink, of course...
And I drank because I was bored."

Now my son is almost 16, and he has not been tormented by the desire to fool around for a long time.
All energy is focused on choosing what he will do for a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age, or my husband, who was in and out of trouble with the law before we got married.
A father cares for his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love."
Why did the girl burst into tears during the exam, when she hadn't even failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school.
Well, it will have a tail.
So what?
I will retake it.
Millions of students know this.
What is it all about?
Polish MFA believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
Polish MFA believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the relevant statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively looking for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is sure that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As the website kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

Choose a case of the optimal size: things should not bend at the bottom.
It is not recommended to hang several bulky things at once in one case: they can crumple.
If you value order and neatness, cherish your things, want to keep them and extend their service life - order a case for clothes.
Go to the large catalog and choose a product of the color and size you need at a bargain price!
"Not a hat for Senka": when a velvet jacket makes a mockery of a man
Velvet jackets dominated the social events of 2021.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
His example was twice followed by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not meet the royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi also tried the trend.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the data of service analysts received by Gazeta.Ru, they began to be bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are represented in almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted is the Gucci model, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci."
When choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a shaggy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Ilya Vakhoshkin, fashion expert at Lamoda, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the most important thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event, - explains Vakhoshkin. - It is also suitable for those occasions when the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie."
Another important criterion, compliance with which makes it possible to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must acquire the right advanced party with wealth, - the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brummell" believe. - The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to special social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Pretty Brummell" are sure: the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will also be inappropriate, but if it is a question of "a manager from among those who control this event, then - "yes," he has such a thing in mind."
If the employee is of a lower rank, and his goal is the desire to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to win financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will accurately assess this with the phrase "not a hat according to Senka," - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so forced.
And it is not at all associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it is paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not a bargain - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
The penny is dropping.
And who is in the overlap then?
As usual - the ordinary buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians affect the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good bribe.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then they will most likely not fit in.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "handsome men," but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slavish condition and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not aware of his slavery and vegetates in a silent, unconscious and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave who salivates when he smugly describes the delights of slave life and admires a kind and good master is a lackey, a boor."
Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the coronavirus strain "omicron"
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron."
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination in six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"With previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling for revaccination to be carried out in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has been ill and has been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and has been ill, then he has received "hybrid immunity," that is, there are a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizers," the expert said.
G7 warns Russia of 'large-scale consequences' if it invades Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA, France and Japan) have published a statement on the results of the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international obligations with respect to transparency of military activities," which US President Biden spoke about during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a heavy price to pay," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement added.
Earlier in the afternoon, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective than omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug for COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality, if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Aleksei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite "Russia's occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is confident that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
"Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," reads a statement published on the website of the British government.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Truss, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of "big consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any incursion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression towards Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
It was about the negotiations in the "Normandy format."
The North Atlantic Alliance has also come out in favour of a dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format."
The representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, stated that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "signed up to the inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Ways of returning money stolen through online stores revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online shopping and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of large losses if bank card data falls into the hands of malefactors, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund procedure.
"Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is assigned to the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service," said the representative of Promsvyazbank.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Artur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2."
Although Scholz declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany, bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia may use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to get into the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said it will help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains a point of contention.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not publicly committed to stopping the work of Nord Stream 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to shut down a gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional aide said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, a position echoed by G7 officials on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more closely.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room has been removed, so the second window is partially visible.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial layout are doubtful.
But I know these apartments very well and I can see perfectly how they have been re-planned.
May all be well with them.
It always surprises me when they write about the means to wash the sink, toilet, windowsills, taps.
You wash them once a year at Easter, so you have to wash them straight away.
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Development wants to give writers residencies
The state will transfer to the future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers the federal property inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
Writers' residences will be created on its basis, the Ministry of Digital Development, which will be the founder of the fund, told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
The Ministry of Digital Development is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of a fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the foundation will be charged with taking care, among other things, of the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Literary Fund.
"A significant number of real estate objects that previously belonged to the Literary Fund of the USSR have become the property of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the writers' town of Peredelkino, the village of Komarovo in Leningrad Oblast, and others," the press service of the Ministry of Digital and Mass Media told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
The draft decree prescribes that the Fund's charter should reflect that it is "created in order to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
"The creation of conditions for creative activity" means the creation of writers' residences in different regions of Russia on the basis of the transferred property, in which there would be comfortable conditions for creativity," the Ministry of Digital Development explained to our publication.

Doctors warned about the danger of prolonged use of blood-thinning drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after contracting the coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before being vaccinated against the coronavirus.
Physician-therapist, immunologist Irina Yartseva said that self-prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood-thinning drugs are not intended for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in a hospital, and had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning drugs that prevent excessive formation of blood clots) as indicated.
She reported that obscurantism is now taking place - everyone is drinking anticoagulants for a long time and, against this background, is suffering complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The chief preventologist of the Urals Federal District, the scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in an interview with URA.RU, said that Russians now often use anticoagulants indiscriminately before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are citizens who decide to start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And during a preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruising.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of the appearance of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the large Lakewood Evangelical Church, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that wealth and prosperity await devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cawley was repairing one of the church's toilets when he found thousands of packets of cash and cheques under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery appears to be related to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not incur any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cawley could not claim the money because the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the award and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood church.

A new case of human infection with the bird flu virus has been recorded in China
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus has been recorded in China.
This was reported by the RTHK radio station with reference to a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reports.
The infection was contracted by a 68-year-old resident of the urban district of Huizhou in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept poultry in the household.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 virus strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
Brazil obliges citizens to present vaccination certificates when entering the country
In Brazil, it was obliged to require a Covid passport from those entering the territory of the state, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luis Roberto Barroso.
CNN Brasil reports about this.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exemptions are persons arriving from countries where there is a proven lack of vaccine.
"The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for holding New Year, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic," Barroso noted.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged tourists who were not vaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
A scheme for complete protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
In an interview with Ura.ru, virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia, Anatoly Altstein, revealed a scheme for complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are produced. This does not happen when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
But inside, after vaccination, we mostly produce immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you administer both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the medic said.
The chief preventologist of the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that it would help that in this case the protection of the body, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseinov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to my dog (who died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, petting, love and games for a pregnant bitch, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It wasn't taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after their dogs, even though they wailed that there were 200,000 of them running away (pomskies), I just took them by the hand and led them in the other direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, which ran somewhere there.
Mass anti-vaccine protests continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against Covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards reading "It's a fake pandemic" and "I won't be vaccinated."
A large protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a Covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, MD," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve that title.
That's just one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans brought only death and plunder to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has already detected "omicron" in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of coronavirus "omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was described in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six regions of the WHO.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively distributed since the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts are concerned that, according to preliminary data, the new strain may outstrip the "delta" strain, aka the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially, several hundred people are currently ill with "omicron" in the Kingdom, and according to estimates, up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2 thousand people will be taken to hospitals daily.
Which the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to "omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?

Curious Belochka, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, people communicate easily and naturally, and when meeting in person there is nothing to say.
And to see a person live, perhaps it's not what you expected, it didn't catch on - hence the attitude.
When she meets her man, then her views will change.
And again, the Soviet era is called the "time of devils."
Back then, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love for one's neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is today's ideology - money at any price.
Talkers like Globa have little faith (indeed, none at all), but even if so, the time of the demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad, communal apartment with Bolshoi Zelenina maintains communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain the warmth of the relationship of the older generation.
Maybe this is due to the fact that there were no newcomers in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and no one canceled the blockade brotherhood.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.

$135 billion went to applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps grew globally by 25%, and the number of downloads by 8%.
The most popular in the world were various video services.
Users downloaded the video editor CapCut the most, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed significant growth in the period from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in applications grew even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the market of mobile applications in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began its post-pandemic recovery.
"Will this "return to the physical" slow down the growth of the app economy? Not at all," the authors of the report believe.
India became the leader in the number of app downloads: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the USA (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of gadgets on iOS, as before, spent more than users with Android: iOS accounted for 65% of all spending in applications.
Among applications, the first place in the number of downloads for 2021 was taken by the video editor CapCut.
It is followed by two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 by number of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (there are two in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to creating and broadcasting videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, the top 10 includes two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Users spent the most in applications for live broadcasts and online streaming," the authors of the report note.
YouTube is the leader here, the top 5 in terms of user spending also includes the TikTok video service, Disney+ and HBO Max streaming video services, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
The first places in terms of the number of monthly active users are occupied by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office rounds out the top 5.
In Russia, the leader in the number of downloads for the year turned out to be the AliExpress shopping application.
It is followed by the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 applications are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE application, online taxi service DiDi, YouTube client Pure Tuber, retailer application Dixy and online store Samokat.
All over the world, people have adapted to the pandemic by switching to mobile life, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The industries that did the best were those that helped people connect both virtually and in person," said App Annie's head of research, Lexi Sydow.
The revenue of the mobile games sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and the video design is minimal.
The top 3 most popular games in the world included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the leading games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, the company's analysts named the growth in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growing popularity of financial applications among Generation Z, for example, applications for investors Robinhood, as well as a further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians were warned about a new fraud scheme
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, director of products at Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call acquaintances of the victim via video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for distribution for the purpose of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Lead system engineer at Varonis, Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I will add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow much make-up and walking in short skirts, showing stockings and tights on legs.
This is the provinces, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In the big cities, Muslim women also wore makeup and showed their buttocks.
That's how it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but not the same cosmetics.
Listed are five actions that will help avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and for good reason.
Over time, diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being at the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often a "weekend migraine," said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the System Medicine Clinic, Zuhra Pavlova, in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics, who have a headache, fatigue and weakness at the weekend, are particularly likely to suffer from this.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to the change in conditions.
At the weekend, our lives change radically.
"We sleep for a long time, lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more, but drink less, the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a small withdrawal begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness."
The late rise plays an additional role.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then there will be a reaction that is called jet lag.
It occurs in travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most over the weekend.

South African scientists announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
In South Africa, they announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to a (level of) vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... calls into question the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of healthy nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calorie content, composition and glycemic index - may be listed under an unfamiliar word in the product's composition.
Several dozen names, essentially designating sugar, can be presented on the label.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other digested sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black treacle), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"In other words, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, since at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Baerbock, stated that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, as part of the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline still "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Indian Prime Minister's Twitter hacked
Hackers broke into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked that the new reports be ignored.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - they restored access to the account.
The page of the Prime Minister of India was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund with the help of cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted for the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
Turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians voting in total.
As Agence France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has in many ways enlivened the final weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken out in favour of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of presence of the European Union in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour has repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians is the choice of France."

The world's first drone with a laser weapon has been successfully tested in Turkey.
The Eren UAV was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 m, reports MIR24.
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the novelty reaches 3 thousand meters.
After passing the appropriate tests, the UAV should enter service with the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticize article on Russia-U.S. relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "present a united front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes one reader's comment.
"Europe is not ours to "lose," and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," said another.
The patches can also be applied to the lips.
The hydrogel used in the production of Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch is a high-tech polymer that provides increased absorption and transfer of highly concentrated natural plant essence to the skin, fits tightly to the skin and gives a feeling of freshness.
When transferring nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimizes the associated loss of moisture and causes the essence to penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km north-east of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The source lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing a new generation of jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will begin to create ANKA-type jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was reported on December 11 by the freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Aleksei Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: hull and the like," Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA vehicles, Arestovich said that we are talking about reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the joint forces in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a plant for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense entered into an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will provide personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions have escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
The Straits Times reports about this.
Two of the predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were heading.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because of the protective netting installed nearby.
The standoff ended after staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singapore zoos, arrived at the airport.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid have a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Nutritionist Beth Kitchin, a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure to a greater or lesser extent.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 pills without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid cereal with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men over 50 should eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75 thousand people may die because of the omicron strain
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus, up to 75 thousand people could die in England in the next five months, if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand deaths will be recorded in the country due to the omicron strain, and a total of about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, at the peak of the morbidity, hospitals will receive more than 2 thousand infected people daily.
"A major coronavirus response may be needed to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed if the omicron strain turns out to be more infectious than the delta variant, and current vaccines are unable to rule out infections," said mathematician Roseanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the Health Protection Agency of Great Britain informed: if the rate of spread of the omicron strain continues at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were detected in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.

The global demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the global ship register, the number of yachts ordered amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds and above will not decrease, writes "The Guardian."
However, they are becoming more numerous.
This year, 25% more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a rush on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, if only their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of hardship, space travel, living on yachts or flying in their own planes cause irritation in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of ordered super-yachts is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the 183 meter yacht REV Ocean.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool," as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, as, for example, on the fighter McGregor's yacht, a platform for martial arts, have become common.Professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilke, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, given that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
It's just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emissions footprint came from his 162.5-meter yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't get much sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels with a draught of less than 50 metres.
Dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to bowel cancer identified
American scientists have determined what volume of alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express writes about this.
Experts came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
What's more, moderate male drinkers have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they have no idea how advanced these four-legged pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how the intelligence of animals is developed.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but there is not yet enough statistical data for accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and their ability to learn is not inferior to that of a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, they prepared for trade between the US and Russia
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future regarding the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere."
If you are offered something that is obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offerer.
And in relation to Ukraine, a bargain is being planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are carried out covertly, and they quickly and immediately go on the offensive, rather than waiting for the group to be discovered and counter-forces deployed," he noted.
China promotes the development of the railway industry
China's advanced technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Vehicle and Equipment Exhibition held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said company representative Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed."
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd rolled out the first domestically developed double-deck high-speed electric trains for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Feng Yaosiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-end equipment production in the global market," said Feng Yaoxiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a complete set of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosiang, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operating mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin, in an interview with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of cerebral vessels are the most frequent causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the charity Dementia Research UK said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
The former president of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, is in need of psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the doctors' council created under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which Georgia does not have.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage receiving medical care after the penitentiary service officers subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to overturn the punishment and restore his former rights.

In Spain, there were protests against COVID passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their placard, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for the choice of citizens to be respected.
In Valencia, vaccination certificates will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city denounced a medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88 thousand patients have died.
Russia also plans to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted draft laws on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit the venues of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or illness, or a certificate of vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and plane.

Steep ascent: how the Chinese become downhill skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow the collection of 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure, landscaping work is also being carried out in the region: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term task is to provide comfortable and interesting holidays at Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games adviser Justin Downes says China's ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downes.
Many resorts are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still have to actively develop and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now none of the local residents are out of work.
More and more shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes, they are opening catering points with national cuisine.
Taiwu now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach world standards.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world may be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down the progress of mankind in the issue of universal access to health services, said the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
On the occasion of the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on December 12, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut from "Democracy Summit" broadcast at White House request
The speech of the Minister of Digital Technologies of Taiwan, Audrey Tan, at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was transferred to a mode without video, according to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Ms. Tan showed was compiled by CIVICUS, a South African nongovernmental organization, and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free," and the PRC, DPRK, Laos and Vietnam in red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the image on its side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy."
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to Washington's "one China" policy.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
Organized by Washington, the "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."
They give you information as if they are preparing food, and there is rotten meat everywhere, in fact, the butcher keeps every last piece of meat.
It is a classic of journalism to create a news story out of nothing.

China strengthens prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land border checkpoints
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular ordering to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border checkpoints are located in order to further prevent the infection from being imported from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving at cities with land ports of entry are required to take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land border checkpoints that meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
In an interview with Izvestia, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of any prospects for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long road we have traveled with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose approaches on Russia on a number of issues.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress has been observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach in matters of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of COVID nasal vaccine dangers outside hospitals
Those who have been vaccinated with a nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may develop allergies and need medical help, so the first points for inoculation with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported to TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University, Sergei Netesov.
It is easier to set up nasal vaccination points at airports and shopping centres, but I would only do this in medical institutions at first.
The fact is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sits next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience is gained in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the inoculated person with nasal congestion blows his nose after injection.

Attention, question - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get on the ski track if he was behind on the turn before the gate?
And the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was, but in fact I wasn't even the driver.
I had my license, but I didn't know how to drive.
They offered to drive 250 km one way at MAZ!
Young, bad, agreed.
The owner is nearby, sipping vodka, I'm on my way.
First, like a king, he took the centerline!
A line formed behind me.
I missed it.
Then the belt broke at the police station.
Then the traffic police stopped us.
The convoy was well organized, and their car broke down.
It needs to be towed.
The owner of MAZ explained that he was drunk and the driver was inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?
You don't stumble, you don't fall.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the omicron strain of coronavirus were recorded per day - RT in Russian
During the day, 1239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected in the UK.
Sky News reports about this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137 people.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that 75 thousand people could die in England by April due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including because of the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions on Russia and not suffer," the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the TV channel "Russia 1."
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States was considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is confident that this is impossible.

Ksenia, you don't have to convey anything to my mind, my mind has to figure it out for itself!
"The inability of the mind, separated from the Spirit, to perceive" - what are you talking about?!
Imagine that you need to explain this on your fingers to an unintelligent child, how will you do it?!
(Note that a child under 3-5 years of age still has open channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you do!)
New Caledonians reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in the voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
The majority of residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France claimed New Caledonia as its own.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative and territorial status.
Paris and the New Caledonian government have a 1998 agreement, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice, two years apart.

WHO tentatively considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the event of a new variant of COVID-19.
According to information as of December 9, "omicron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigenic profile of the protein of the "omicron" strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with "delta,"" the WHO technical report says.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta."
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that so far there is no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and may also compromise on Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm," suggests that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, having reached an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FIGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.)," the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "a war against everyone."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine may make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former people's deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of the population that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is likely to lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives."
In the course of this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting the government," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
An event that will be a strong shock to society may lead to this.
"The event should be large enough to cause a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
This scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or Russia's aggressive actions, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has more than once rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the survey data of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

To the author, thank you for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova had died, it is very upsetting to learn this.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
There was such a heat of passion, emotions were off the scale, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They also rejoiced at the other victories, as they cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the then Soviet athletes.
I once saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and there they rolled watermelons down a ladder onto the side of a ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself many times in my youth worked on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and did not meet watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the melon grower and not before the beginning of August.

Bra-balconette with soft lace cups, on frames.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The lateral inner part of the cup, in the area where the straps are sewn, is reinforced with a non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon on the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical pits on the side panels made of a single layer of microfiber prevent the fabric from twisting in large sizes.
I didn't like the article very much, it was angry and venomous.

Poet arrested for protest on Red Square: "They give 10 days for quoting Yevtushenko, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetvrosiibolshechampionpoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
He was first detained on 23 January on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of general culture in Russia, and there is also little hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the arrest and to reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How did the police officers treat you during the arrest this time and previously?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the officers were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, no matter how ridiculous it may sound in a certain context of this word.
At Pushkinskaya, the riot police took and took hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandably.
With the exception of the monkey being blown to all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if, after the action, at least a few people start writing their poems under this hashtag, I will have served these 10 days for a reason.
Maxim, according to the protocol, in private, at least speak the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of those around them, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfect Russian and nevertheless uses the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, the transcript is kept in the old-fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want a lot of words, just say no!

Before that, turn all assets into liquid shares.
And to sell these shares little by little, opening an account in any bank in the world.
Sell not in dollars, but in a currency less dependent on the United States, such as Swiss francs.
And then file for divorce from America.
However, this is not all that keeps Americans in the United States.
What keeps them going is the belief that the United States is better than anywhere else.
That's how they're raised.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of clove, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or boil the root vegetable, rather than fry it in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods containing carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as table sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex distribution
Candidates for departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (included in the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search results, you can watch the animation novelty "Encanto," but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screencast (a pirated copy of the film shot in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TNT TV channel (part of Gazprom-Media) is available.

Lyudmila, China now has advanced space technology.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more correct to say that Poland only adapted the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan "Outskirts are not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, on the whole, does not really change the essence.

A wide circle, framed by "molecules" of light, provides the most uniform and bright illumination of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, does not lose its relevance and allows you to favorably place accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such luminaires is the weightlessness of the construction.
Due to the thin, almost invisible cables, which are adjustable in height, there is a feeling that the chandelier is floating in the air.

Three portions of syrup is too much for my taste.
Two were just right.
Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Micro Ultimate orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient in that it has two surfaces of different softness - high hardness and slightly more than average.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropackage."
This means that there are 2000 coils per berth, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique fine-tuning.
"Micropackage" is the highest-frequency of the entire variety of Dimax spring blocks, therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: Combinations of coir and natural latex layers are installed on the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long had the status of a classic, since it conveys to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides the right support for the back, then the latex gives the surface adaptation to the human body.
Case: The model comes in a simple Aloe Vera knitted case.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to the earth or different.
If very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder project team.

Metaverse will change Russian business
The theme of metaverse became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverse and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverse should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have the traditional Olivier and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one forces me to eat it all at once.
You can eat it by the spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish labor, time, and money it took her in training.
And after completing 5 quarter jumps, she was left without gold.
And she also understands that she will not be able to hold out for 4 years until the next Olympics, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who wasn't just playing sports or can't imagine all the circles of hell she went through, DON'T CLIMB WITH JUDGEMENT.
The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn into a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in the price of goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks has already exhausted itself" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the global research department at Otkritie Investments, reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if we compare ourselves with ourselves, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, but it is sluggish.
There is another problem: there are a lot of environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All sorts of eco-taxis that pick up waste from the house.
Yes, the recycling point is banal - it is used by the marginalized.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the market leader in Russia in terms of revenue.
For 10 months of this year, it managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The growth of Kia's sister brand Hyundai is even more significant - more than 35%, and the proceeds from the sale of cars are estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also in the leading positions in terms of the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year at Hyundai, it increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had stronger dynamics of price increase.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"At the same time, Mercedes-Benz has a good increase in sales and weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater increase in financial capacity, - explained Tatiana Arabadzhi, General Director of NAPI. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year, are demonstrating fantastic performance."
The Russian Lada demonstrates average market indicators in terms of revenue growth dynamics (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
In terms of financial capacity, companies whose unit sales of cars fell in 2021 are at the same level as last year: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red at all - for 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production, covering the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other automakers regularly rewrite the price tags on their products.
The volume of the automotive market in Russia in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation, as well as the desire of automakers to recoup past losses, contribute to this, experts say.
In the conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of previous periods, which they could not include in the price of cars earlier,
says Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst for the automotive industry at VTB Capital.
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are doing very well right now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With supply increasing, the scope for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, notes independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now trying to get the highest profit from each sold car, Burgazliev notes.
An increase in the production of cars is not expected for at least the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the deployment of the US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of an "invasion" by Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There were never such plans," the head of the White House said, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will redeploy forces to the Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We're going to have to put more U.S. and NATO troops on the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a solemn obligation to defend against any Russian attack," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use by Kiev of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If during the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible beer and wash a cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I'll find a normal place for myself, without the eicharny layer, where you immediately talk to the manager.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, it is not effective to immediately disconnect the call, and it will most likely not be possible to blacklist the caller.
Because in order to confirm his lie about his involvement with the security agencies, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and cajole.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
This is such nonsense...
I don't believe that was the case at all.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
They got to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except the very, very rich...
And it would not be simpler to leave people alone from forced labor, of course, if our people care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
As in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and the infections became less...

Maria Kartashova, what does "in response to this" mean?
I don't voice my thoughts, I curse you all mentally.
I mentally cut off the heads of everyone who did not give me a seat, I mentally send them to the ditch and burn all the cars that interfere with my passage, mentally everything!
And I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!
Peter, Nicholas II during the years of his reign did not sign a single death sentence.
Even to such lawless people as Koba and his brigade.
And Bloody Sunday is an invention of the Bolsheviks.

Alexander Sokurov's pupil's film won the European Oscar for best editing
The Oscar-nominated Russian film "Clenched Fist" won the award of the European Film Academy (it is also called the "European Oscar") in the nomination "Best Editing," reports "Moskovsky Komsomolets."
The competition jury, which voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skill of the filmmakers.
This time, the film by Jasmila Zbanic (Bosnia) "Where are you going, Hades?" received the maximum number of awards.
The main character of the film is a translator at the UN mission, who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching Fists," directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells about the complex relationship between a domineering father and those who want to free themselves from paternal guardianship of growing children in North Ossetia.
Earlier it was announced that this film was nominated for an Oscar as the best film shot in a foreign language.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, off topic.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the Azerbaijani-Russian joint venture KamAZ.
