From my perspective, the literature program was shaped by Balzac-era women based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Dostoevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belles-lettres, of course, from the perspective of those very ladies of the Balzac age.
Psychology and the suffering of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, that's very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 Mattress.
The "Micro-Package Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: a medium-firm surface is formed by latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, while the moderately soft side is a natural latex slab.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, breathable materials should be highlighted.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is well ventilated naturally, just like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area is preserved.
Also, an extended warranty period applies to the mattress.
The manufacturer's official warranty period is 5 years, but in practice the mattress lifespan is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover included in the set.
Buy an orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress - it is recommended to support optimal spine alignment while sleeping.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

No support at all.
I shudder to remember those feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests are at the doorstep, and cutlets are still sizzling on the stove, while Mom is bustling around mopping the floor.
Lord, he was already too weak to sit at the table.
Then wash the dishes and clean the house.
One week before the holiday you shop for groceries, two days of cooking, and one day of cleaning afterwards.
And what about the guests?
They are doing well, and they must bring a cake with them.
Ever since then, I haven't liked holidays or guests.
Even for my family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
I make them delicious treats and bake very often just for fun.
Germany: Fourth COVID-19 vaccination is inevitable.
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigelt, is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, Die Welt reported this.
"We expect that a fourth vaccination will be needed by summer at the latest, fall at the latest," says the expert.
Furthermore, Wiegandt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be administered "in combination with a flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omikron".
The new version is especially dangerous.
The likelihood of re-infection with Omikron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
The preliminary research conducted in South Africa provides evidence of this.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an adapted vaccine for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 strain, BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts are urging for an acceleration of vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zalzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
According to Zaltzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omikron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very compelling in this regard," emphasized the expert.
The Pontoon21 lure, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
She (like the Kalikana Vib series) stands out from many other vibes because it was originally designed with the intention of being used for bottom fishing, not just casting and retrieving.
These lures have a higher specific weight than their close-sized analogs, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top bumper made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration when wired vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter bait", Bet-A-Vib shows a fairly aggressive game when fishing.
Often the most effective animation is a simple monotonous one, that is, the movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, which can cause a snag.
Additionally, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for sea bass and large perch in winter, especially in the middle of winter when a pinpoint and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Reaching the end point of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter pond trout fishing.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It has also been noted that Bet-A-Vib can agitate a passive catfish, even one that does not respond to live bait.
When casting Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates distance and accuracy.
This lure is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with monofilament and braided lines even of large diameters.
For catching pike, perch, bream or perch, in addition to uniform trolling, "stepping" is sometimes used, with "tapping" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in heavily weeded areas, you can switch out the treble hook for a double hook, which will reduce the chances of snagging.
Among its class of lures, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable in operation and, as a result, one of the most productive.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya has reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
On Sunday, December 12, the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri announced this.
Currently in Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group.
They have airplanes too.
They are also digging trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Gardabia airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt), according to Anadolu agency.
Haled al-Mishri also stated that Russian mercenaries are attempting to seize the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Preserve presence
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, according to the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is receiving support from the Kremlin.
Where else could mercenaries be?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is reportedly active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to exploit mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article states.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the CAR.
This group is not registered with any government agencies or in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel records.
This company is under US sanctions.
Earlier, the ambassadors of the 27 EU countries approved sanctions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13th.
The situation in Libya.
The Supreme State Council of Libya de facto serves as the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, according to TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and presidential elections from December 24th to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will take place on time are rapidly decreasing," is noted in the material.
The Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, according to Sky News Arabia.
Russian Foreign Policy from a Russian Perspective
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% think that failures predominate.
Examples of successes: "Protected and restored peace in Syria", "Resolution of the "Nord Stream-2" issue", "Frightened the world with powerful weapons", "We have taken back Crimea".
The main failures cited in the Public Opinion Foundation's research are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world."
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-based bureaucracy - all government services have also become digital only.
The Dubai government announced a complete abandonment of paper-based processes and a transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
The Emirati news agency WAM reports this.
Today marks the start of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said on Saturday the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, the internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government entities will be done only in digital form through special information platforms.
The new initiative affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digital document processing began in Dubai in 2018.
According to the authorities, over this period 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Previously, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens two days a year.

Production and export of cars in Turkey have fallen below the 2020 level.
Production and export of cars in Turkey sharply decreased in November due to the devaluation of the lira.
According to Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association, the industry's results for the 11 months were worse than last year's results.
According to the association, in November in Turkey 115 thousand cars were produced from factories, which is 20% less than the year before.
Approximately 75,900 machines were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
If the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive trend compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, the production of cars in the 11th month of 2021 was 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November depreciated by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSB entities have received a deferment on credit payments in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium businesses, according to the correspondent of Kazinform.
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, in accordance with the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium Businesses" on April 9, 2021 - Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He reminded that the deferral of loan payments provided for banks and microfinance organizations included deferral of payments on loans issued to MSB subjects, including individual entrepreneurs, before April 1, 2021, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB.
In the borrower's statement, another payment deferral period could have been specified.
During the deferment period, the creditor's claim and notification of overdue debt repayment, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor, were suspended - the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
For 2021, applications for payment deferment on loans were received by second-level banks from 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 SME subjects received deferment for a total amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
The MFI has received applications for deferral from 131 MSB subjects, of which deferral was granted to 95 subjects for a total of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily carry the "okmiron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Okmiron" coronavirus strain could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation he encountered no resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of an immune response, he became very fast.
It seems that he has more of these spike proteins, spikes, maybe than he should have, their antibodies weren't cut during mutations, comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "okmiron" more easily than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response from the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is often the case with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, while elderly people in their 60s just get away with a sneeze.
Sergei Puryasev concluded that the immune response of the young man was completely inappropriate: where one could only threaten with a finger, he was beating like a gun at sparrows.
The doctor also reminded that there are dangerous side effects of coronavirus and the most unpleasant one of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first case is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case often only the symptoms can be suppressed - all hope lies in the body's own ability to heal.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of organism intoxication - this includes fever, weakness, and malaise.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, as well as abdominal pain, can also be a sign of an emerging problem.
Meanwhile in Russia, they may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old by the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the genome engineering laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, noted that this category of people is very actively suffering from COVID-19.
Teenagers who go to school have the most contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, like kindergarteners, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at MIPT, to Moscow 24.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID-19.
The authors of the study examined adipose tissue remaining from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected, showing a strong inflammatory response in the process.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to evade the response of the immune system.
Probably SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Semen Golosheikin, a candidate of biological sciences, named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik Radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting themselves even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
He said that at the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role.
Unhealthy habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disturbances, and a sedentary lifestyle can also contribute to the development of dementia.
Among the first signs noted by the expert were forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its development, added the biologist.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining an appropriate level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic involvement to prevent the onset of disease.

Egypt has returned around 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the last 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, December 11, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, the chief inspector of the Department of Repatriated Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, reported this on Al-Hayat TV channel.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has been able to return 29,300 artifacts.
He said that only this year 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
The department staff are currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon their return, cultural artifacts will be restored and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the artifacts returned was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
On July 4th, Christie's auction house held an auction where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (approximately 680 million rubles).
This provoked dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artifact of art was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and not put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic ended up in Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively striving for the repatriation of illegally exported ancient artifacts from the country in recent years.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, as Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a distinct people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a distinct people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
English: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not provide their employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse is not commenting on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is no longer part of any literary associations, has broken away from imazinism, and is now a lone figure, yet he is well-known and in demand, sometimes harshly criticized by critics, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Soviet Russia" was released.
The main success was that on the end of June 25th, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No modern-day poet has been honored like Sergei Aleksandrovich, he was the first!
Furthermore, this promised very good money - the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the factory director received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofya Tolstaya, and had to arrange a family life, support his sisters Katerina and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed like life was getting better, there was something to be happy about, but for him everything was mostly dark, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized.
My friend, my friend
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is that the wind whistling?
Above the empty and deserted field
What the grove looks like in September
Alcohol is making my brain foggy.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin looked very bad, obviously ill, and had deteriorated significantly.
More and more often there are breakdowns and nervous breakdowns.
And the cause is probably not just alcoholism...
In any case, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Aleksandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
Say, related to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedora Dunkan, was recovering his health in a clinic near Paris under Professor Petrus Gannushkin (Esenin would return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
Here is plenty of evidence of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this soil, and calls to the police - scattered in dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrifying novel with the green snake has been rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly stayed with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Amazingly, despite Esenin's relatively good income, he never had his own home in either Moscow or St. Petersburg, instead renting apartments, staying in hotels, or staying with friends.
Starcev is remembering.
He would only come to stay the night, and in most cases in an incoherent, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the stair landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
After coming to his senses, he started coughing continuously, spraying the sheet with blood.
Even Esenin himself, after his travels around Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the States at the time, but Dungan brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
I didn't see anything there except for taverns and streets...
I'm almost done and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, he did drink, of course...
I drank because sadness overwhelmed me.

Why didn't he tell his daughter that this wasn't school?
She will have a tail.
So what?
They will retake it.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the European Union.
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon".
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pawel Jabłoński, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new paths".
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons in many points around the world.
As reported by kp.ru, the European Union has previously implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
Europe has declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk has imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that have previously imposed sanctions against Belarus.

"Not Fitting for Semyon: When a Velvet Jacket Makes a Man a Joke"
At the 2021 social events, velvet jackets dominated.
Daniel Craig was probably the first to announce his new fashion statement.
In September, he appeared at the premiere of the movie "No Time to Die" in a velvet raspberry blazer and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice wore an inappropriate green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, which violated the royal dress code, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend caught on with both Lionel Messi and himself.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's blazers in Russia.
According to analysts from the service, reported to "Gazeta.Ru", their products have been purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm velvet blazers with a lining and a fitted silhouette come in dark beige, burgundy, dark blue, and of course, black.
The average price of these models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury blazer segment, velvet is represented in almost all brands this season - both Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most sought-after model is Gucci, which was worn by the brand ambassador Jared Leto at one of the premieres of the movie "The House of Gucci".
When choosing expensive brand jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric is obtained with a velvety external texture and a smooth inner side.
Cheaper options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also last less.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin from Lamoda warns that when it comes to velvet jackets, the most important thing is not the model or style, but appropriateness.
Velvet requires evening light, so this blazer is perfect if you are attending a party or a formal event, explains Vakhoshkin. It is also suitable for occasions when the dress code is specified as "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion to consider when choosing a velvet blazer is the status of its buyer.
According to the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Krasavchik Brammell", a man in a velvet jacket should first of all acquire the right advanced company with enough money. People who usually wear velvet jackets usually belong to the group of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests pairing a velvet jacket with equally dressy items: classic trousers with arrows, monotone shirts, silk bow ties, loafers with brushes, cufflinks.
Simple and everyday things will look out of place.
The fashion experts from "Brammell's Beau" are sure: it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about "a leader from those who organize the event, then - yes, such a thing would be appropriate".
If an employee is of a lower rank and their goal is to advance higher in a complex corporate hierarchy or earn financial bonuses, then it is best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not according to Senka's hat", say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Ambiguous feelings from the voice.
This is an unnatural tone, so rehearsed.
It has nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
From the bottom of my heart, I wish you luck in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billion dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy sources are also not in demand - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is high demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
Who is in charge then?
As usual - a regular customer.
Does the sheriff care about Native American issues?
Therefore, it is not fair to consider Western politicians as idiots for "missing" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent wage.
I didn't see any attractive people in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average of passengers.
Maybe if these characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it off to the whole train, then they probably won't be approached by anyone.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious, and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
The slave whose saliva flows when he voluntarily extols the beauties of slavery and praises his kind and good master is a flatterer, a hypocrite.
The immunologist stated that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omikron" strain of the coronavirus.
Vaccination four to five months later can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Omikron".
Immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov made a statement that the vaccine will be available in six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, as "a very long period".
The expert stated that previously the timeframe was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic illnesses - after four months, calling to parallel the vaccination campaign with revaccination.
Krutchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or has been infected and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and then infected, they have acquired a "hybrid immunity", meaning they have a high level of antibodies and enough neutralizing antibodies, clarified the expert.
The G7 has warned Russia of "significant consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The countries of the G7 (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan) have released a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It is emphasized that "Russian military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” the statement said.
The ministers then call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities," as President Biden said during a video call with President Putin of the Russian Federation on December 7.
We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to fully implement the Minsk agreements in order to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the G7 also said.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have immense consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation in our collective and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier today, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed "a unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and they made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the Omikron-strain.
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omikron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower than other forms of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 medication.
We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omikron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
Scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe illness when infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omikron-strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the Omikron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The Ukrainian Minister of Defense has accused Germany of blocking NATO arms deliveries to Kiev.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov has accused the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and machine guns for drone strikes.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on guns, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
On Sunday, Ukraine's Ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of escalating the conflict in Donbas, despite the "Russian occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kiev is expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense, added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chair of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic and spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

Mercedes has lodged a protest against the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
The German team Mercedes, whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen, has filed a protest against the final race result, according to the Formula 1 press service.
Mercedes believes that the rules of Formula 1 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the race.

According to the second - Vettel overtook Hamilton before the allowed "restart" zone.
Let's add that the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, in which Vettel beat Hamilton by 2,256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship, is provisional until the protests of Mercedes are considered.

The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the reinforcement of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.

Ways to get back stolen money from online stores have been revealed.
There are several ways to get back money stolen from online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
The experts on information security were revealed in an interview with RBC.
To reduce the risk of large losses if a bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of your savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend getting a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, a refund procedure can be initiated.
According to the rules established by payment systems, the responsibility for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use the service, said a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a statement with the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money can be refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the money to the customer if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19th, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that only in 2021, 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud, from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances may be to create a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Schulz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces at the borders of Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholtz declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has stated that he will be calling on Chancellor Merkel to oppose the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has declared that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disputes.
The European Court has fined Poland for determining that judicial reforms implemented by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not taken on any public obligations to stop the "Nord Stream 2" project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials have informed members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking congressional staffer in the United States reported on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the G7 on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
They removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so the second window is partially visible.
Those who are unfamiliar with the initial layout are the ones who doubt.
I know these apartments very well and I can see how they have been re-planned perfectly.
May all be well with them.
It always amazes me when people write about ways to clean sinks, toilets, windowsills, and faucets.
You wash them once a year for Easter or something, so you have to scrub them right away.
Just don't let it get dirty.
The Ministry of Culture wants to give writers residencies.
The state will transfer federal property inherited from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund of the USSR to the Future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers.
On its basis, writing residencies will be created, the Ministry of Culture informed "Parliamentary Newspaper", which will become the founder of the fund.
The Ministry of Culture is preparing a project for a presidential decree on the creation of a Fund to Support Russian Writers.
The explanatory note specifies that the fund will be entrusted to take care of, including the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures once belonging to the Soviet Union Writers' Union and Litfond.
The Russian Federation has taken ownership of a significant number of real estate objects previously belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR, including those located in the writers' village of Peredolkino, the village of Komarovo in Leningrad Oblast, and others, the press service of the Ministry of Finance told the Parliamentary Gazette.
The decree project stipulates that the Fund shall be established for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers.
Creating conditions for creative activity is understood to mean creating writer's residencies in different regions of Russia based on the transferred property, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity, the Ministry of Culture explained to our publication.

Doctors have warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned of the dangers of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before coronavirus vaccination.
Dr. Irina Yartseva, a general practitioner and immunologist, has warned that self-medication to prevent possible blood clots after COVID-19 could trigger a stroke.

She reported that there is a current epidemic of people taking anticoagulants for long periods of time and experiencing complications such as hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The Chief Preventive Medicine Specialist of the Ural Federal District, the Head of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in an interview with URA.RU, said that Russians are now often taking anticoagulants randomly and before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Doctor Tokarev, citizens are trusting dubious advice on the Internet and beginning to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, one week before vaccination, start taking anticoagulants of their own accord.
And during the pre-vaccination checkup, doctors notice bruising.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid $20,000.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
An incident occurred at the large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packets of money and checks under the insulation.
He gave the church's find to Austin, but, according to him, he didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
"We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him.
It appears that the find is related to the theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then around 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of twenty-five thousand dollars was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooley could not claim this amount since the reward's expiration date had already passed.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had initially offered a reward of five thousand dollars and later received an additional twenty thousand dollars in a donation from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin regarding the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya's words, her actions - this is her characterization as a "real person".
Therefore, the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not that "she is financially much richer than all the writers" as they write here.
There are people and rich ones, but not all of them behave so brazenly, so provocatively, like this lady.

CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also included in the list of exceptions are those who have arrived from countries where there is no evidence of vaccination.
The situation is even more serious when considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival, and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic," noted Barrozo.
Previously, the authorities of Brazil have mandated that tourists who are not vaccinated against coronavirus infection must observe a five-day quarantine.
The full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, and Russian Distinguished Scientist Anatoly Altshtein revealed the full protection scheme from coronavirus infection in an interview with Ura.ru.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and applying a nasal vaccine.
When administered inter-nasally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
After vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies) formed inside.
If you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet about double vaccination," the medic said.
The Chief Epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using intranasal vaccination in combination with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help those in such a case, as the body's defense should presumably become maximum.
The Nizhny Novgorod Region's Minister of Health, David Melik-Guseynov, previously stated that a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
He said that this is the same picture seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Anna, hmm...
I used to talk to my dog (who has been gone for a long time) like this - if you're ready to trade a warm home, food, affection, love, and games for a wet nose, then go ahead.
But the parrot was trained and generally smart.
My society chose and I went home.
On the video is a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I have held back many owners so they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they heard that 200 thousand were running away (in Pomsk), I would take them by the hand and lead them in the other direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that was running somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccination opponents are not stopping.
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and government plans to make vaccination against Covid-19 mandatory.
Starting from February of next year, undocumented people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards outraged by the government's policies on healthcare held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some were holding signs that said "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A large protest rally against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In an autonomous community, a COVID-certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife venues.
The authorities of several regions of the country have decided to introduce sanitary passports in response to the increasing number of coronavirus cases.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The protest started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
The group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashcheva-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor of medicine", probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
I agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans brought only death and plunder to any country they appeared in.

The WHO has already detected the "omicron" in over sixty countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new strain of coronavirus "Omikron" has been detected in 63 countries.
Experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the spread of the strain.
According to the organization, by December 9th, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
Despite this, it only began to spread actively from the end of November.
The WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, based on preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, previously stated that the Omikron-strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omikron" will displace "Delta" in the coming months.
In Britain alone, the number of those infected is estimated to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially, only a few hundred people in the Kingdom are currently suffering from the "micronom" and up to 10,000 according to estimates.
British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at the peak hospitals will be transporting more than 2,000 people daily.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent research, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "Omikron" strain is 32 times lower than against other types of illness.
It is currently unknown how the Russian satellite "Sputnik V" will react to the "Omikron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omikron" strain.
Why do we need to see stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE more detailed execution of your exercises.
It's unclear in the first exercise how to do it: sitting on your heels or standing on your knees as written, but then how do you support yourself with your hands on your thighs?
Hands on hips?
Curious Bunny, you are right, communication online is quite different, it's easy and relaxed to talk, but when meeting in person there is nothing to say.
To actually see a person in person, maybe it's not what you expected, it didn't catch on - that's where the attitude comes from.
When one meets their person, then their perspectives will change.
Again, the Soviet era is referred to as the "time of the beasts".
Then people believed in God much more honestly than today.
We were practically raised according to God's laws (love your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today - money at any cost.
Globby's type of faith is scarce (or even nonexistent), but even if it is, the time of the gods has come in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina still supports communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Maybe this is related to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we seem to be seeing each other more and more at funerals.

Human babies, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, fussy, pushing, fighting, and wrestling just like their little "cousins" in the wild!
It's too bad they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, and scratches are common, but no boomerangs!
And what for?
Did you not calculate the force when you pushed your brother?
Are you always so agile that you never accidentally hurt anyone and never injured yourself?

At least seven people have died and 175 have been injured as a result of powerful storms that have hit the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and its neighboring Minas Gerais.
TASS reports this with a reference to rescue services.

App Annie, an analytics company, released these data in a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began its post-pandemic recovery.

India has become the leader in the number of app downloads, accounting for around 20% of all downloads.
Behind them are the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.

The industries that helped people stay connected both virtually and personally have achieved the greatest success, commented Lexi Sidow, head of App Annie's marketing research department, on the report's results.
The mobile gaming sector's revenue in 2021 reached $90 billion. Casual and hyper-casual games, with minimal or no story and video presentation, were the leaders in downloads.

Russians have been warned about a new scheme of scammers.
Criminals have started to look for new tactics for fraud in video messages.
"Izvestia" is writing about this with a reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Product Director, Zurab Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is deepfakes.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video featuring a copy of the person for distribution with the purpose of extortion.
Such counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, as a malicious hacker can put people in awkward, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios, said the expert.
Alexander Vetkol, a lead systems engineer at Varonis, in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this can create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I will add it.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town where the local mentality did not allow to dress up too much and wear short skirts, show stockings and tights on the legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, Muslim women wore makeup and showed off their hijabs.
That's how it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no same cosmetics.
List five actions that can help prevent diabetes.
Blood sugar level issues are one of the most common in the world.
However, some people don't give this much importance, and that's a mistake.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Doctors recommend changing your drinking habits - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Eating too much sugary foods can raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The onset of illness is not only affected by poor nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to exercise a lot.
Experts recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices, and the increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova talked about "weekend migraines" in workaholics.
Poor self-care on the weekends can be attributed to several factors.
The cause of feeling worse after workdays is often "weekend fatigue", said Zukhra Pavlova, a renowned endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research associate of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, and head of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, in her Telegram channel.
According to her, those who work hard often suffer the most, with headaches, fatigue, and weakness on the weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are plenty of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to a change in conditions.
On weekends our life changes drastically.
We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less - argued the doctor. - A small break starts due to lack of coffee.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fragmentation.
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you stand up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
She arises in travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor plays the most decisive role in worsening well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have declared the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
South Africa has reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omikron-strain of coronavirus infection.
According to the assessments, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to the level of vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection - according to the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
Experts clarified that the medication can save from a severe course of the disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the Omikron-strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than last year.
How much hidden sugar is in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excess in the diet can lead to Type 2 Diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar may be listed under an unfamiliar word in the product composition - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index.
On the label there may be several dozen names, essentially representing sugar.
One of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products but also in ketchup, hot dogs, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to labels and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years.
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has stated that the import of gas is becoming less important for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
He said that Germany plans to be a climate-neutral country by 2045, completely phasing out the use of gas, oil, and coal.
"So in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it is currently an important resource for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the US had made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Previously, the German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, it was stated in the course of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also stated that the pipeline is currently "not in compliance with EU regulations".
Thank you for the interesting photos!

Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Indian Prime Minister.
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
At Modie's office, they were asked to ignore the new messages.
The Prime Minister's representatives stated that they quickly responded on Twitter - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12th ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the preliminary results announced on Sunday, December 12th at noon, the majority of New Caledonia's residents voted against independence in the referendum.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonian residents taking part in the election.
According to France-Presse agency, commenting on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt" as supporters of independence called on voters to not participate in the voting.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, arguing that the new COVID-19 outbreak on the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3%.
Separatists have declared that they do not recognize the results of the last election and will challenge them at the UN.
On Sunday, December 12th, it was reported that French President Emmanuel Macron is set to speak on the results of the referendum at the Elysee Palace.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has greatly invigorated the last few weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have expressed their support for the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated multiple times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valérie Pécresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Catalans to remain French.
In May 2018, Emmanuel Macron declared that he would not take a position because it was not his responsibility.
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex expressed a "strong desire for the choice of the Catalans to be a choice of France".
Hi, Sveta!
I have embarrassed you a lot... still embarrassed and ashamed.

Turkey has tested the world's first unmanned drone with laser weaponry.
Successful tests of the world's first drone with laser weaponry have taken place in Turkey.
The "Eren" drone has been tested at distances from 100 to 500 meters, according to "MIR24".
The device is capable of remotely neutralizing explosive objects using a laser.
The maximum flight height of the new model reaches 3,000 m.
After passing the necessary tests, the UAV must be put into service for the Turkish military to use it to destroy explosive devices without the need for sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article about the relationship between Russia and the US.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article in which he described his vision of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and makes a number of insulting remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "unite as one front against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," - RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of its readers.
Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
"The United States and its NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," noted another.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region.
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near Shikotan Island in the Kuril Islands.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin producing new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, they will begin producing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
On December 11th, this was reported by an external advisor to the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Alexey Arestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
"They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: fuselage and the like," - Dialog.ua quotes him.
Arestovich commented on the main features of ANKA drones, saying that they are reactive rather than piston-powered UAVs.
He said that this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpass it in all characteristics.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory by the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of an unmanned aerial vehicle was carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with several private companies since 2010.
The Ukrainian General Staff had previously classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the joint military operations in Donbas.
On December 6th, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a modern military drone factory had begun in the country.
He said that Ukraine is intending to use drones.
On September 29th, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kiev Oblast for personnel training, testing, and servicing of Turkish UAVs Bayraktar.
The press office of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum a "big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
Lions have escaped from Changi Airport in Singapore.
The Straits Times reports this.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions that had arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions curled up on the roof of a container.
The animals couldn't move away from him because of the protective fence set up nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and a tranq gun and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that a lion escaped from its owner in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, and was roaming the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no people were harmed.
Experts warned of the risk of cancer due to Vitamin B9.
Studies show that an excess of Vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a folate deficiency are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
The University of Alabama professor in Birmingham, dietitian Bet Kitchin, advises to keep track of the amount of folate consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if there is a significant deviation from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablet form without a doctor's recommendation, to be sure to monitor dosage, and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fain called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people may die by April due to the new coronavirus strain.
British scientists' forecasts show that up to 75,000 people in England may die in the next five months due to the spread of the OMICRON strain of the coronavirus if restrictive measures are not tightened during the winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported this with a reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no less than 25,000 deaths due to the Omikron strain, and a total of around 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the hospital's illness, more than 2,000 infected people will be admitted daily.
Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the Omikron strain proves more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines are unable to prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
The UK Health Security Agency previously informed that if the spread of the Omikron strain remains at its current rate, there will be around 1 million cases of infection in the country by the end of the year.
By the middle of December, the Omicroon strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently in the UK, there have been 1898 cases of infection with the OMICRON-strain of coronavirus, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, the head of the British Department of Health, Sadjid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already be reaching 10,000 cases.

Demand for superyachts has increased by a quarter worldwide.
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking world records despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the global yacht registry, the number of ordered yachts totaled 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money for a floating fortress costing 50 million dollars or more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, there are becoming more and more of them.
This year there were 25% more orders for ships than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been this much excitement in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people would go to the office and meet with their business partners in person, but now the absolute majority of them work remotely and hold meetings via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
He says that people just crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the wealthy and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that the wealthy do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, luxuries such as space travel, yacht life, and private plane rides can cause resentment in society, as the elite do not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to implement this given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, not only is the number of superyachts ordered impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 have a length of the keel greater than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke is building a 183-meter-long yacht called REV Ocean.
After it is launched, this will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" as well as a submarine boat designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
Superyachts have become commonplace with helicopter pads, outdoor cinemas, and on some, like boxer McGregor's yacht, even a fighting ring. Professor of Economic Anthropology at an American university in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance when you consider that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail went to his 162.5 meter long yacht, Eclipse.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to sail the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke sympathy from others when, like Australia's wealthiest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, they complain on YouTube that there is no berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol consumption per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express newspaper is reporting on this.
Experts have concluded that consuming four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
The likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, moderate drinking men have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of oncology, only noting that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at a two-year-old child's level.
All dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't even realize how intelligent four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to definitively determine how animal intelligence has evolved.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study has shown that a dog can respond to 89 words or phrases in sequence.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they understand nothing of politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to outwit their owners.
Experts believe that representatives of some breeds show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
Some breeds are traditionally considered to be canine geniuses - for example, Labrador Retrievers.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and have the same learning capacity as a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade negotiations with the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future regarding US guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you won't negotiate, you will just send the offer away.
Regarding Ukraine, "a trade is in the works," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
They prepare secretly, quickly, and immediately move to offensive actions instead of waiting for the group to be discovered and countermeasures to be deployed, he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transportation industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Equipment and Manufacturing Expo held in the city of Zhuzhou in Hunan Province /Central China/.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted a representative of the company, Hou Zhao Wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with data technologies to ensure increased reliability and operational performance of rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transportation vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd., intended for export to Europe.
These trains will travel along the railway lines of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries at a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour.
In November, a trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will be running on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement along this metro line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
Fan Yao-shan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), said that the Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness.
Fan Yao-shan said that this sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created a cutting-edge system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities, through a series of independent research and development.
According to Fan Yaosan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloshekin in an interview with Radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
He said that signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments such as difficulty concentrating, planning, and reduced abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about whether hearing loss can be an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease as well as one of the risk factors for its development, said the specialist.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disturbances, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, as of today, medical professionals do not know of any effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
He said that studying foreign languages and engaging in active communication can help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logic.
Golosheikin said that there are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular cognitive skill and ability training through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic thinking, said Golosheikin.
Previously, a charitable organization for dementia research in the UK has stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 and over.
Doctors have identified the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, which cause the patient to have difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia specialists have named aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to convey what they want to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment.
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consortium created by the Georgian ombudsman, to journalists.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
The specialist said that the stable problems are problems with mobility, coordination, and changeability of character, noting that this is not outside the normative framework and that the ex-president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to boycott the receipt of medical assistance after staff of the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to repeal the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

In Spain, protests against COVID passports took place.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to the Europa Press agency.
Approximately 3,000 people participated in the rally in the Catalan capital.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife venues.
Many manifestants came to the rally without masks.
With their posters, they accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for unvaccinated people.
The government submitted a bill on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with either a certificate of vaccination or a certificate of a past illness or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be applied for train and plane trips.

Steep Climb: How Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will help to achieve the 1 trillion yuan goal set by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taivu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening works are also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Zhangjiajie, where resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and enjoyable vacation experience at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, the Games Organizing Advisor, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year more and more Chinese people go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the significant changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Ma Kong, 70 years old, lives in Chunli, not far from the venues of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that there has been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chuni, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and winter sports equipment are opening in the country.
Cafeterias serving dishes of national cuisine are opening on the slopes.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment should reach world-class standards.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress in achieving universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have stated.
In recognition of World Universal Health Coverage Day on December 12th, the WHO and WBG have released two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic has caused disruptions in health care services and has put an excessive strain on health care systems.
In this context, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population by immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and WB have emphasized that the pandemic has caused the "worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation is pushing over 500 million people into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket.
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres declared that the coronavirus pandemic has pushed more than 100 million people into poverty and almost four billion people have virtually no social protection.

Reuters: Taiwan's Minister was cut off from the "Summit for Democracy" broadcast at the request of the White House.
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tang at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a video-less mode, as evidenced by the Summit's YouTube recording.
Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the image was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the cause was a map that showed Taiwan as a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries of the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked on it green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam - red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could be at odds with the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources claimed that after the map demonstration, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from December 9th to 10th with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit of Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the chief editor of the "New Newspaper" Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.

The classic of journalism - creating news out of nothing.
They are not boiling meat, but horns and hooves, obtaining a substance like glue.

Generally, there are just as many harmful substances from recycling waste as from decomposing it.

But what does this have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, etc.?
Write that they are "miserly and did not return the money".
It's none of your business how many and when they have children until they hang them around your neck.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to judge them?
Probably only in education is it like this...

The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring the strengthening of prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those who arrive in cities with land border crossings must submit at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day that the corresponding provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
Additionally, it is noted that cities hosting land border crossing points that meet certain criteria may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reported a "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States.
The Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Ryabkov, assessed the prospects of Moscow-Washington relations in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that the long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of any kind of improvement in relations, it is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to the long journey we have taken with the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
"The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat indicated.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's attempts to impose its approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not risk making optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cyber security, there has been no progress.
Russia is calling on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that its signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Previously, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, stated at a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal COVID vaccine outside of a hospital.
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first points for administering this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
TASS reported that Sergei Netesov, a virologist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Head of the Department of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology at Novosibirsk State University, has made this announcement.
Organizing vaccination points with nasal vaccines in airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would only do this initially in medical facilities.
The thing is that there is a small chance of an allergic reaction to the vaccine, but it is advisable for the person to stay near the doctor's office after receiving it.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy medications that work literally within a minute or two, which can be very useful sometimes," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, thinking about vaccination in shopping centers can be done when there is experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection when their nose is blocked.

They say that those who truly believe make up the church.

No one should speak either about themselves or about those who believe as they do that they alone are truly faithful.
Because if they can say about themselves that they are truly believers, then others can say the same.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the Omega-strain of the coronavirus have been recorded in the last 24 hours.
In the UK, 1239 cases of infection with the new variant of the coronavirus have been identified in the last 24 hours.
Sky News is informing about this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omikron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3137.
Previously, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast estimated that in England by April due to a coronavirus outbreak caused by the "Omicron" strain, up to 75,000 people could die.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that are imposing anti-Russian sanctions.
The Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose sanctions against Russia and not suffer oneself," said an official representative of the Kremlin on the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
It was previously reported that the US is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
Additionally, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
Sberbank head German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

Xenia, you don't need to explain anything to my understanding, my understanding is obliged to figure it out itself!
What do you mean by "the incapacity of the mind, separated from the Spirit, to apprehend"?

Remember that a child between the ages of 3-5 still has open channels of communication with the spiritual world, and the child may know more than you!
The residents of New Caledonia have rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on New Caledonia's independence, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French Republic.
On December 12th, French television channel BFM.TV reported this.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The turnout for voting on this day was very low: around 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by separatist calls to abstain from participating in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the residents supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
Approximately 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia which allows the region to organize a referendum on its independence twice with a two-year gap in between.

The WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that the "omicron" strain is less dangerous than the delta-strain of the coronavirus.
There is also data showing a decrease in vaccine effectiveness against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9th, "Omikron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the "Omikron" strain suggest a decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that the severity of the disease may be less severe than with "Delta" variants, according to a WHO technical report.
The organization notes that all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are progressing either mildly or asymptomatically.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than "delta".
In Russia, two cases of infection with the Omikron strain have been registered.
They "were previously immunized," reported the Gamaleya Center.
Anna Popova, head of Rospotrebnadzor, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky have been named.
Former Verkhovna Rada Deputy Vadym Denisenko listed four possible scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without Western support, and also, possibly, will make compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
Denisenko's first option, which he called the "ideal storm," suggests that Ukraine will be abandoned by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its involvement.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
Simultaneously, prices of key commodities that we traditionally export are decreasing <...> internal protests and resistance to the government from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups) - added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the case of high turbulence in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian government may be willing to compromise on Donbass, which could lead to internal conflict within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, according to a former MP, the probability of such a situation is 50-55%.
The third possible development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of people who are not in agreement with President Zelensky and the implementation of "populist initiatives", which could lead to a takeover of the power bloc.
In the event of such a crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting of power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is transforming Zelensky into the "Father of the Nation".
Some event could lead to this which would be a strong shock to society.
Denisenko said that the event should be significant enough to elicit a response from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, according to the former deputy.
The Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine multiple times.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Previously, on November 11th, data from a survey conducted by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the approval rating of the Ukrainian president had dropped to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since he was elected head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next Ukrainian presidential election, only 21.8% of the vote would be cast for incumbent President Zelensky, while 14.5% would be cast for former President Petro Poroshenko.
Only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had passed away, it's very saddening to find out.
I remember cheering for her at the Olympics in Seoul, it was a live broadcast for us residents of the Primorsky Krai, it was real time.
Such a surge of passions, emotions were soaring, I remember the joy when Elena won.
We were also happy for the other victories, such as cheering for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes at the time.
I once saw a documentary on one of the Central American countries on TV, and there they were rolling watermelons onto a ship's deck like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrously large.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and have never encountered watermelons heavier than a pood.
I am buying watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and no earlier than the beginning of August.
A balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
English: A balconette bra with soft lace cups on frames.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of the strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
This element specifically allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated through the festoon along the decolletage and under the bust.
The vertical ribs on the side panels of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to curl up at larger sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was nasty and venomous.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square said: "Evtushenko gets 10 days for a quote, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained at Red Square with a poster that had the hashtag #poetforrussiamorethanapoet written on it.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was issued a protocol under an administrative article for repeated violation of the order of conducting a public event.
He was first detained on January 23rd at Pushkin Square during a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, but unfortunately now interest in it has been lost, due to the decline of general culture in Russia, and also to give a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems online under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to further explore the message of his poem.
How were the police officers treating you during this and previous arrests?
What did they ask in the department about your campaign?
This time the employees were more polite, the detention was as polite as possible, as funny as it may sound in some context of this word.
The OMON officers were taking people away harshly at Pushkinskaya.
They asked the usual question about motivations.
When we heard it, we looked at it with understanding, if not approval.
Except for the four-sided blow-up monkey, everything was extremely proper, but I knew what I was getting into.
If at least a few people start writing their own poems after this hashtag campaign, I won't have wasted these 10 days.
Max, according to the protocol, talk privately even in the language of the Tumba-Umba tribe.
At public and official events, people speak the language of the surrounding area so that everyone can understand what happened in Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is protocol and nothing more; incidentally, Angela Merkel speaks Russian very well and yet still relies on a translator.
At official events, stenography is still done by hand, and the stenographer does not have to know multiple languages.
Don't want to hear a lot of words? Just say no!

Researchers have revealed how potatoes can help fight age-related disorders.
The research showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
Root vegetables contain vitamins B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folate, and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help to function the systems of the organism.
Additionally, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of dietary fiber, it is beneficial for the digestive tract, and regular consumption may also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, root vegetables are best boiled or steamed, rather than fried in oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as with other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products with high carbohydrate content that quickly break down into sugar, such as sugar, sweetened non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in their production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current production deficit can only be offset by imports.
Yandex will remove Lostfilm, lordfilm, and other pirates from its search results.
Departure candidates
In 2015, copyright holders from the "RAEK/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites in the Russian-speaking internet and most of them ceased to exist, according to Karen Kazaryan, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated new release "Enkanto", but judging by the video quality, it is what is known as a bootleg (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a movie theater).
The series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available on Filmix, which can also be found through search engines.

Wall lamp Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
A wide circle, framed by "molecules" of light, provides maximum uniform and bright lighting of the space.
Atomic or molecular design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, remains relevant and allows for advantageous accents to be placed in the interior.

Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190.
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimat.
This model is convenient because it has two different surfaces in terms of softness - high stiffness and slightly more than average.
The product is composed of only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves to be of the highest quality.
Springs: a block of independent springs "micro-package" is installed in the center of the model.
This means that 2000 coils are allocated to the sleeping area, which work completely autonomously.
Their functioning gives a unique point-by-point adjustment.
The "Micropack" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks of "Dimax", so it has a clearly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, then the other has a coconut coir.
This combination of fillers has long held the status of classic, as it gives the mattress not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties.
If a coil mattress provides proper back support, then latex gives an adaptation of the surface to the body of the person.
The cover: the model comes with an Aloe Vera stretchy knit cover.
At the customer's request, it can be made either removable or stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load capacity for the sleeping area is 170 kg.
Warranty and Safety: Warranty Period - 3 Years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
Orthopedic foam used in a mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will be searching for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported "Actual Camera" on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds, and then search for life there.
For the TARTU project, scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus's clouds.
It has been assumed until now that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
On the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Suppose we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth life or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not originate on Earth.
If it differs, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mihkel Payusalu.

The multiverse will transform Russian business.
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
This event became an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and monetizing them afterwards.
We should consider metaverses as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a result of businesses striving to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
With the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalizing assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are transferred into a digital format.
Anna, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want anything too greasy or unhealthy.
Of course, we will have traditional Olivier salad and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can have a spoonful, try it, and that's enough.
Indeed, there are ten weekends ahead, so you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.

After completing five quadruple jumps, she was left without gold.
She also understands that she won't make it to the next Olympics in four years, meaning she will never be an Olympic champion.

The British economist was unable to make a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to make a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts would be doomed to failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the coming year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know if the increase in prices of goods is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has run its course" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, in the midst of the pandemic, the continuation of an ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Additionally, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty alleviation and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Previously, the head of the Global Research Department of "Open Investments" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar rate in 2022 remain, although the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the US dollar, Shulgin named the Federal Reserve's monetary and credit policy, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.
I'm forced to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if we compare ourselves to five years ago, there were fewer containers.
Now it's better.

Russians gave auto dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP.
Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars in the 10 months of 2021, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (RAMP) agency.
To put it into perspective, approximately the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the government to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in September, President Vladimir Putin said that the amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2020.
In the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads in terms of revenue.
In the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
Kia's related brand Hyundai has seen an even greater increase of more than 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated to be 279.3 billion rubles.
Hyundai is leading in both brand and average car price increase - over the year, Hyundai's average car price rose almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price increase.
Sales volumes of Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to statistics from the Automakers Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars during the same period than the previous year.
Hyundai has increased by almost 12%.
Completing the top three leaders in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese, Mercedes-Benz had a turnover of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand saw both sales volume (up 37%) and the average weighted price of a car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles) increase.
Mercedes-Benz is experiencing both good sales growth and an average weighted price - higher, for example, than BMW - which is leading to increased financial capacity, explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji.
Chinese brands are showing fantastic sales growth rates, significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada has demonstrated average market performance (plus 28%) in terms of revenue growth, with Russians spending 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months.
Companies such as Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan, whose sales of cars in units have dropped in 2021 compared to the previous year, are financially strained.
UAZ is in the red - Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand for 10 months, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of supply issues with auto components and production shortages that have affected the global auto industry, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in one year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Prices for their products and other automakers are regularly updated.
Experts believe that the Russian automotive market volumes in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car shortage, inflation and the desire of automakers to make up for past losses are contributing to this.
In the context of a car shortage, I think many car companies have been able to partially pass on the costs of previous periods that they were unable to include in the price of cars before.
Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital, says about the automotive industry.
I assume that in terms of finances, automakers are feeling very good right now, sustaining high margins on sales.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of car prices observed throughout 2021, with new car prices rising faster than inflation, according to an expert.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantity and in money, mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the cost of cars slows down, and automakers will be able to make their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now striving to get the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
It is not expected that production volumes of machines will increase at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is further fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
In light of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original price, according to an expert.
Biden expressed his opinion on the redeployment of US military forces to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The US leadership has never considered sending American military forces to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
President of the United States Joe Biden made this statement.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
He emphasized that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukrainian territory, the US will redeploy forces to the NATO Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
Biden stated that we will have to deploy more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect from any attack from Russia.
Previously, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intentions of invading Ukrainian territory.
He also indicated that Moscow sees a problem in Kiev's use of drones supplied by Turkey in combat, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are getting closer to our territory".
I'm leaving these interviews right away.

I can even smile at you from a distance.
