28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.

České dráhy has invested over 31 billion in the modernisation of carriages.
They are now equipped with air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, the state-owned rail operator has invested over 31 billion Czech crowns in the upgrade of train carriages.
One-third of the carriages is currently equipped with air conditioning, and roughly one-half of trains has a closed toilet system.
Save for 2012, the annual amounts spent on modernisation have been steadily decreasing.
Over the past six years, Czech Railways invested over 31 billion in the modernisation of carriages.
The state-owned carrier operates over two thousand locomotives, electric and diesel units and about 2,130 passenger carriages.
As a result of the investment, the average age of locomotives and separate units has been reduced by two years and that of conventional carriages by six years.
With 60 percent, the carrier spent a larger portion of the investment on regional transport, with 40 percent going into the upgrade of long-distance carriages.
The average age of locomotives and units currently stands at 19 years.
However, upgraded older carriages are counted towards the indicator as brand new.
Without the upgraded vehicles, the average age of traction vehicles of ČD would increase by ten years.
The average age of passenger carriages tends to be higher. If the upgraded carriages are counted, the average age is 23 years.
However, taking into account only the age based on the date of manufacture, the average age of these carriages would be 33.4 years.
Conventional trains consisting of carriages and hauled by locomotives are gradually disappearing from railways not only in the Czech Republic but worldwide and replaced by motorised or electric-powered units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 units, and the number of conventional carriages dropped from 2,716 in 2011 to 2,132 in the middle of this year.
The railway operator is mainly getting rid of older carriages fitted with faux leather seats and without a locking system to prevent doors from opening when the train is moving.
From January to July, the operator has had 110 of these carriages scrapped.
The rolling stock investment of ČD includes, for example, the purchase of 50 carriages for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the operator plans to use on the line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a master agreement for the purchase of electric-powered units for domestic express railway links.
Under the contract, it plans to purchase up to 30 motorised units and up to 20 electric-powered units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for several months but they seem powerless to stop it.
The authorities themselves admitted as much.
The editorial staff of the online news provider Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now woos motorists to visit Lipno to take a stroll among the treetops or through the Olympic park.
The motorway operators know that it is there illegally, but claim there is nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of similar ads all across the country.
Officials blame a weak law, which does not provide for the immediate removal of illegal billboards,
and having to go through a bureaucratic exercise first.
What happens in the meantime is that the company changes its name and evades the authorities.
Alternatively, the company moves the billboard by a few meters, and the authorities have to start again from square one.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted a few months ago that there was an illegal billboard on their property near the busy national road between České Budějovice and the Lipno dam.
Even in three months, the officials have not managed to have the illegal portable construction and the giant advertisement taken down.
It seems as if nobody cared that it was standing right next to the road, in the fifty-metre protection zone, which must be kept free for safety reasons.
Road operators argue that they cannot deal with the billboard because of legal loopholes.
An option would be simply to load in onto a truck and take it away.
"This is not something we can just go ahead and do" said the spokeswoman of the Road and Motorway Directorate, Nina Ledvinová referring to a complex bureaucratic process which must be followed before the billboard can be removed.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which Aktuálně.cz started monitoring in spring, is not unique and points to a general problem which the authorities are unable to handle effectively and efficiently.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial staff found dozens of similar portable adverts located illegally alongside the road or in its close proximity.
The situation in other regions is similar.
"We find it difficult to force companies to remove the billboards," said the head of the transport department of the regional authority in České Budějovice Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are handling similar cases.
According to Klása, loopholes in the law which ties the hands of officials are to blame.
First, they are required to contact the billboard owners in a bureaucratic way to remove the advert.
The bosses of the companies are often impossible to get hold of or they use the trick, Aktuálně.cz already reported on when they looked into the matter: move the portable stand with advert just a few metres away and the order to remove the illegal billboard is not worth the paper it is written on.
This is because the authority is required to specify the location of the illegal billboard.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates change it is considered to be a new billboard, and we have to approach the owner again," said Klasa.
A new law will not help us in this instance.
The situation could change with a new law, which will ban billboards next to motorways and reduce their numbers near to first-class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and portable adverts will remain the same as before.
This will not really help the authorities.
Companies can continue renting out illegal advertising space and make tens to hundreds million Czech crowns a year and get away with it.
For example, the billboard promoting Lipno is owned by Commerz Billboard.
Officials are familiar with this company as the municipality of České Budějovice is currently conducting three separate administrative proceedings against the company for illegal billboards.
The company could be fined up to three hundred thousand Czech crowns in each case.
This concerns a number of adverts placed illegally within the protection zone of a class 1 road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, said Jaroslav Mráz, said the head of the transport department of the municipality of České Budějovice.
While the billboard followed by Aktuálně.cz is not yet among these cases, this is likely to change soon.
According to the spokeswoman of the Road and Motorway Directorate, Nina Ledvinová, the company does not respond to repeated written demands and the case will in all likelihood land on the table of regional and later municipal authorities.
Commerz Billboard is among the suspicious companies that are difficult to contact.
The company does not collect its mail and it has closed its official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It is also not clear who is behind this company.
In the past, the company's mail was sent to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, whose claim to fame is the bitter dispute with the head of the Czech representation of Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has, however, denied having any connection to it.
Yet this spring, when the Road and Motorway Directorate started to look into the Lipno billboard case at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had the government officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guest house, where the company is said to have its new address.
The motorway operators have not had any luck with contacting the company at this address either.
This seems to be a futile exercise.
Lack of transparency with respect to the change of addresses are not uncommon..
A few years ago, we fined one company two million Czech crowns in total.
The company then changed its company ID number, and that was it.
The bailiff returned the case, the billboards were still there, maybe in other locations.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
It is like fighting windmills, admitted one of the officials on condition of anonymity.
Nobody is yet looking to amend the law.
Aktuálně.cz spoke with several MPs, who have shown interest in the problem,
but so far we have not seen any action from them.
In contrast, there are now MPs, who want to extend the period for keeping the billboards next to major Czech roads.
The government has rejected it.
Billboards are a sensitive topic for many politicians on national, regional and local level, and they are often torn over the issue.
On the one hand, they know that people want to see less of them, but on the other, they themselves need them for election campaign advertising.
I do not share the relatively widespread view that the universal remedy when something does not work is to change the law.
Statisticians estimate that this year, farmers will harvest less grain and more rapeseed and poppy.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower compared to last year.
This year's harvest will still be higher than the average over the past five to ten years.
In contrast, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy is expected to increase by 3.9 and 2.5 percent, respectively.
The harvest of grains will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers are expected to harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
This follows from the estimate as at 15 July, released by the Czech Statistical Office.
The initial estimate released a month ago was more pessimistic as it assumed a 10 percent drop compared to last year.
Last year's harvest of cereals was above average.
This year's harvest exceeds the average for the last five to ten years.
In contrast, the harvest of rapeseed and the poppy is expected to be higher this year.
This year, the rapeseed harvest is expected to be 3.9 percent higher than the 1.256 million tonnes harvested last year.
This year's poppy harvest could increase by 2.5 percent year-on-year.
The projected decline in grain harvest is due to a decrease in planted areas as well as a reduction in the yield per hectare by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare.
This year, planted areas decreased by three percent.
The harvest of winter wheat, which is the most important grain in the Czech Republic, is expected to drop by 3.3 this year.
This is despite the fact that the areas planted under winter wheat have increased.
The decline is due to a lower yield per hectare, which is expected to drop to 6.04 tonnes.
Czech Statistical Office projects roughly a one-fifth decline in spring barley, which is mainly used in the production of beer.
This is attributable to a 15.2 percent reduction in planted areas and a lower per hectare yield.
In contrast, the harvest of winter barley is estimated to grow by 6.3 percent.
The rye harvest is also expected to be higher year-on-year.
The Czech Statistical Office estimates rapeseed harvest to increase year-on-year to 1.305 million tonnes,
on the back of a 7.3 percent increase in planted areas.
However, the yield per hectare will be about 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed harvest is projected to be 13.3 percent higher than the ten-year average, on the back of a one-third increase in planted areas.
The area planted with poppy seed has also increased over the past four years
to reach 35,543 hectares this year.
Compared to 2008, when poppy seed was planted on a record area of 70,000 hectares, the planted area has halved.
Thanks to the increase in sown areas, this year's poppy harvest is expected to be a success.
It will increase compared to last year by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons.
The yield per hectare will be about 6.1 percent lower.
The police in Olomouc arrested two men for an assault with a knife and machete, and the court ordered to take them into custody.
The police arrested two men, who on Tuesday attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
"Although the victim tried to escape, he suffered stabbing and cutting wounds which required hospital treatment and further rehabilitation," said the police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
The perpetrators were arrested by the police immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a detention order which was upheld by the court on Friday.
The men could spend between three and ten years in prison.
The police arrested two men detained on suspicion of attacking a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete in the centre of Olomouc.
The attackers inflicted stabbing and cutting wounds on the victim, who required hospital treatment.
According to the police, the attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people on Tuesday noon at třída Svobody.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, said Marie Štrbáková, the spokeswoman of Olomouc police.
This was preceded by a mass scuffle between two families outside the bar trattoria near the centre of Olomouc.
Following an aggressive altercation, two men attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the victim tried to escape, he suffered stabbing and cutting wounds which required hospital treatment and further rehabilitation," said the police spokeswoman.
The skirmish, which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre as several police units had to intervene at the scene, was the result of a family dispute.
Detectives arrested a thirty four-year-old man from Slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc on suspicion of attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a detention order which was upheld by the court on Friday, added the spokeswoman.
Five years ago, a machete was used in another attack, during a mass brawl just a few dozen meters away, before the disco Varna in Riegrova ulice.
According to the police, a group of roughly ten armed foreigners attacked guests of a restaurant who stood in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they were holding knives, sticks and machetes.
Two of the foreign attackers received a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and vacant buildings in the centre of Prague.
You may be surprised to find that you walk pass them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty building are the large former headquarters of IPB in the middle of Senovážné náměstí,
which was supposed to be turned into a hotel.
So far, there has not been any progress.
We often hear how important it is to build new flats and offices in the capital.
Would it not make more sense to take advantage of existing buildings, which are often protected because of their architectural or historical merit?
Right in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Václavské náměstí, there are several blocks of flats which remain empty despite their premium location, size and heritage status.
We have identified these properties in the city centre with the help of the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
The buildings are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, non-transparent relationships between companies, or they are owned by the state, which is unable or unwilling to dispose of them.
The number of empty buildings in the Czech Republic exceeds the number of homeless people.
The initiative wants their owners to be liable for a special tax on these buildings.
This is where they almost succeeded in shooting Fidel Castro; Hitler's brother also lived here.

The Clintons made 10.6 million dollars last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, the former President Bill Clinton earned 10.6 million dollars last year.
The Clintons donated more than one million dollars to charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over six million dollars - was earned in paid speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
The Democratic Party's nominee for president, Hillary Clinton published her tax returns on Friday, increasing the pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
According to AP, Hillary Clinton and her husband, the former President Bill Clinton earned 10.6 million dollars last year.
Most of the Clintons' income - over six million dollars - was earned in paid speeches made before April 2015, when Clinton launched her presidential campaign.
Their tax return shows that the Clintons' paid an effective federal income tax rate of 34.2 percent and an effective state and local income tax rate of 9 percent.
In total, they paid an effective combined income tax rate of 43.2 percent.
Trump has so far refused to publish to take this step and publish his tax returns.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after releasing her tax returns.
According to AP, Hillary Clinton has repeatedly talked about the secrecy surrounding Trump's income not least to raise doubts, whether her opponent is really as rich as he claims.
Trump is said to be worth billions of dollars.
Lower net worth would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, the vice-presidential candidate and the former first lady's running mate, today released his tax returns for the past ten years.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, he donated 7.5 percent of his income to charity and paid an effective income tax rate last year of 25.6 percent.
Polio makes a return in Nigeria.
The Islamist militants from Boko Haram are against vaccinations and are blamed for killing doctors involved in the vaccination programme.
Polio cases have resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government launched an emergency polio vaccination campaign in response of two infected children having been paralysed.
The vaccines were delivered by helicopters.
The Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram, which is active in the area, was against the vaccinations and resorted even to killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, the government is planning to launch an emergency polio vaccination campaign in response of two infected children having been paralysed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed in Somalia two years ago.
The Nigerian government planning on immunizing one million children in the state of Borno and another four million in the neighbouring states.
AP reported that Nigerian military helicopters delivered the polio vaccines quickly to the north-eastern part of the country, where the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram operates.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has been circulating in the area undetected for many years.
The extremist group Boko Haram is against vaccinations and it is blamed for killing doctors involved in the vaccination programme.
On Thursday, their attacks also prevented doctors from getting to the areas where the children were diagnosed with polio.
Both affected babies come with refugees from parts of Nigeria newly freed from Boko Haram.
The Director of polio eradication at WHO told BBC that the immunisation in Nigeria will start as early as next week.
The radical Islamic group Boko Haram operated in the state of Borno for a long time.
International organisations and the government only gained access to the area at the beginning of this year after Boko Haram suffered considerable setbacks in this area.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that new cases of polio are a big disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio was eradicated.
WHO pointed out that could have been spreading among children undetected for two years.
The vaccination programme is for children under five years of age.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all new polio cases in the world.
The number of countries in which polio is endemic has decreased from 125 countries in 1988 to three areas - Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of the women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who escaped from the gang of pimps with the help of the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
Pope Francis wanted to use this meeting to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for stepping up the fight against it.
The Pope met with twenty former prostitutes who were freed from the gang of pimps by the police.
According to the Vatican spokesman, the head of the Catholic Church listened to the moving stories of the women for more than an hour and called on them to look to the future with confidence.
Among the former prostitutes who visited Pope Francis, six women were from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one each from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
The average age of the women was 30.
According to the Vatican, all these women were forced into prostitution and subjected to physical violence.
The Pope wanted to use this meeting to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for stepping up the fight against it, said the Pope's spokesman.
Pope Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican in April and in June on his invitation.
France plans tough action against breeding grounds for jihadists.
They need the assistance from the Muslim community for the measures to work.
The Muslim community is expected to assist the French government in the fight against radical Islamism.
The government of the Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing fundamental changes with respect to mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we shut down 20 mosques and places of worship.
and other will follow, said the interior minister.
The country has over one hundred breeding grounds for jihadists.
"If Muslims will not help the Republic to fight against those who undermine public freedoms, it will be increasingly hard for the Republic to guarantee their freedom of worship," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams trained in France are allowed to practice in mosques and other places of worship.
At the same time he wants to stop the funding of mosques from abroad.
Currently, around 20 percent of the funds for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad, mainly Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf states.
This is one of the ways how preachers get to spread radical agendas in mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he added.
The key to ensuring these objectives are met should be the new French Islamic foundation,
which should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country already has a “Foundation for Islam of France”, which was founded in 2005 by former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin
with the objective to make the financial flows between mosques and countries that that fund their construction more transparent.
The institution was soon hit by internal divisions and rivalries.
"It is a total failure," said Valls recently.
In the aftermath of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate over a new institution that would replace the largely defunct foundation ignited the French political scene.
This urgency has been augmented by further terrorist attacks in France carried out by radicalised Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently said that the new foundation will be created as early as in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure that mosques are funded from domestic sources and to monitor imams.
How the construction of new mosques and various educational centres will be funded is not yet clear
as several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food,
which would in practice be paid by the vendors of halal food for certification.
Part of this money would then go to the foundation.
Another option would be for French pilgrims heading to Mecca to pay a contribution of ten to twenty euros (an equivalent of 270 - 540 Czech crowns).
Every year, around 30,000 French Muslims go on this pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
But this is not all.
According to the Prime Minister, there should only be preachers in mosques in the future who have gone through special educational programmes at French universities.
This is designed to ensure that sermons are compatible with democracy.
We will shut down radical mosques.
The French government is currently on the war path against militants,
and others will follow, announced recently the interior minister.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
It is estimated that there are around 2,500 mosques and places of worship in the country,
of which some 120 are thought to be under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 of Imams and dozens are currently under consideration.
Not everyone is convinced, however, that the French government's steps will make a significant contribution in the fight against radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalized will do so anyway,
because it is not happening in mosques. Young people are being radicalized on the internet, said Severine Labat, a specialist from the National Centre of Scientific Research.
The track cyclist Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint against the French star Bauge.
To advance to the 1/8 finals, the Czech cyclist will have to do well in the repechage heat.
Having qualified among the top eighteen for the sprint event at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the track cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost in the first round duel against the French star Grégory Baugé, the defending silver medallist from the games in London.
To advance to the 1/8 finals, he will have to do well in the repechage heat.
Of the 27 cyclists who started in this event, the top Czech track cyclist finished with the fourteenth-best
200m flying lap of 9.969 seconds.
In the round of 16 he was beaten by the French cyclist Baugé, who qualified in the fifth place and already has a bronze from the team sprint event in Rio.
While Kelemen, was trying to chase after the experienced Frenchman, he made sure to advance in the next round.
Jason Kenny, the defending champion from London, shone again with an excellent performance.
The twenty-eight year old Briton rode the third fastest 200m flying lap in history, winning the qualification in a new Olympic record of 9,551.
It was, therefore, relatively easy for him to defeat as expected Maximilian Levy, who qualified in the last place.
The GB men's pursuit quartet, which included Bradley Wiggins, has also done well as it finished the 4km race in a world record of 3:50.570 and advanced to the finals.
They have managed to improve their previous personal best (3:51.659), which they held for four years from the Olympic Games in London by more than one second.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.
There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement.
I regret that it occurred," he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to come at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to see it through to the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew, and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have.
The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power.
"We saw their boat circling close to them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre lifeboat helm Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we had launched, the strong winds had blown it clear of them," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.
They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.
The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was watching over these guys today.
Judge refuses to deal with the case because of Tluchoř's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who have been accused by the prosecution service of taking bribes in the form of lucrative positions from the then Prime Minister Nečas and his former chief of staff Jana Nagyova in return for a political concession.
The MPs Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř facilitated the passing of tax legislation
by resigning from the Parliament,
only to reappear in influential positions at state-owned companies.
This is why they were suspected of bribery and spent one month behind bars.
The court subsequently ruled that this was illegal and they received compensation amounting to nearly 2 million Czech crowns.
Following the intervention of the Supreme Court, Tluchoř is now acting as a witness in the case.
His wife works in the courthouse at Ovocný trh, where she handles civil disputes.
Still, the Judge Helena Králová (editor's note: Ms Králová is a judge for criminal matters) want to be careful to prevent any possible objections.
The case will, therefore, be likely handled by a different judicial district in Prague.
This is despite the fact that Ms Králová has twice acquitted Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová
for the alleged misuse of military intelligence to surveil the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas.
Tluchoř was not involved in this case.
According to the lawyer, Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary knee-jerk reaction.
I think that the principle of impartiality should not be interpreted in a way that would exclude a court if a witness's spouse or relative works at the courthouse.
I am afraid that this would preclude almost any prosecution, he said in a newspaper interview.
"I find it completely over the top," he added.
Mr Tluchoř's co-accused in this case of political cronyism is Roman Boček, a former official.
According to his lawyer, Petr Toman, a potential objection may have a chance to succeed.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 discussed the indictment of the former chief of staff of the Prime Minister Petr Nečas, Jana Nagyová (today Nečasová) and the other accused in the case of misuse of military intelligence.
Ms Nečasová is pictured arriving at the court with her husband.
Ms Tluchořová was meant to judge statements about Peroutka.
The wife of the former MP was, for example, scheduled to judge a case involving the statements of the Czech President, Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said about him that he was a Hitler sympathiser.
One of the schoolgirls is dead!
The girl appears to have died in an air strike of the allied forces.
The schoolgirl travelled to Syria with her two same-aged friends in February last year from London's Gatwick Airport.
The UK Home Office has not commented on the report of her death.
According to the police, the young Londoners who ran away from home, were secretly taken to Syria across the Turkish border.
According to the media, Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana went to Syria to join their former schoolfriend from London's Bethnal Green Academy.
The case has received considerable attention and led to tension in relations between the UK and Turkey.
The UK's security services estimate that around 600 British Muslims, including some 50 young women and girls have travelled to Syria so far.
Many of them have joined the IS militants and other groups.
Those who return home present a terrorist threat to the UK.
A dream job for six figure salary.
A well-paid job without a university degree.
This is the job of an IT specialist at first sight
and often the second.
The advantage is not only the extremely high salary by Czech standards (in Prague, IT specialists can make up to CZK 180,000), but also very attractive benefits.
The reason is the enormous shortage of IT specialists.
The economy needs thousands of IT experts
It is estimated that the Czech Republic needs 20,000 IT specialists.
According to the recruitment agency Grafton, most sought-after are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from several job offers.
The demand is considerably higher than the supply and employers compete for candidates, said Jitka Součková, the marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
University is not a must.
Higher education is not a must for IT professionals.
Higher education is a good foundation and overall indicator of intelligence and education of the candidate, but it does not tend to have much in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which cannot be substituted by just completing a university, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
IT professionals earn the highest salaries in Prague.
IT professional salaries are everywhere well above the national average.
The highest salaries are paid in Prague and Brno. The salaries in the regions are somewhat lagging behind.
The salary levels in Brno are comparable with those in Prague," says Kubačka.
The highest salaries are earned by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno, they can make between CZK 120 000 and CZK 180 000.
In other regions, the salaries are lower, but they still do not drop below CZK 80 000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
Upon joining, that can make between CZK 60 000 and CZK 100 000.
Graduates are also in demand
While some graduates have no choice but to go straight to the employment office, this does not apply to IT specialists.
Rather than having to attract specialists from other firms, i.a. by engaging in a bidding war, companies often prefer to hire graduates.
This is because they can train them to meet their requirements
Language skills are a must
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession and IT guys need to have at least a decent knowledge of English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we often come across companies, which are looking for skilled and experienced professionals with only an average knowledge of English.
According to the company's Director Mr Kubačka, it is an advantage for an IT support employee to be able to communicate in several languages because this allows him to serve more customers from different countries.
Yes, Google is heaven.
Czech employees can only envy Google staff.
They enjoy flexible working hours, option to work from home or a range of part-time opportunities, not only for mothers.
"Google offers new dads four extra weeks of holidays following the birth of their child," said Martina Joneková, a spokeswoman for Google.
Other benefits include healthcare for employees and their families, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages at the workplace.
Green light is given to those who want to continue learning irrespective of the subject.
The benefits do not stop there.
A well-stocked fridge for free is also quite something.
Healthy lunches (in some localities also breakfasts and dinners) are available at the workplace every day.
In addition, all offices feature so-called micro-kitchens, which are always well stocked with healthy snacks, revealed the spokeswoman.
To prevent waste, the employees can take home any leftovers in the evening.
And the reason for these benefits unheard of by Czech standards?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"We at Google want to promote initiatives and projects, progress or development, ideas and innovative solutions rather than having employees sitting in the office for eight hours a day," added the spokeswoman.
UN has sharply criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Mr Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's lack of respect for international law," warned Mr Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to witness how important and influential public figures have publicly expressed support for armed criminal outfits that brazenly organise refugee-hunting patrols along the Bulgarian-Turkish border."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross the border to Bulgaria irregularly are being automatically arrested," said Zeid.
What is worse - they are often prosecuted and jailed - for a year or longer - if they attempt to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised, despite the fact that under international law, everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
This year, Bulgaria arrested 14,000 migrants, last year over the same period, it was 21,000.
Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world turns.
That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade.
Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.
Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).
Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response, which overloaded servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.
A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.
Many public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.
Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.
Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.
And yes somebody might walk into a door.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.
However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle, the report states.
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.
"It's occurring within a residential area in front of a home," Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.
When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.
"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly meeting some milestones.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic ones like Edmund's, and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I actually haven't asked for a prognosis in forever, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.
It gets better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
It came up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.
Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.
Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.
Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.
In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This one is on track to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.
The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
All the way along his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.
From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
In the movie made about it he said: 'Ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, eating worms and muddy water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should come in under 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units, when freshly washed hands are less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
He said in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.'
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.
Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."
They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'
Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.

Tourists in Portugal are left terrified as a low-flying military jet flies skims beach
Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives
A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.
Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.
The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.
He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
One-half of the funeral services is not complying with regulations.
One-half of funeral service providers do not comply with laws and regulations.
This is the result of checks carried out by the Czech Trade Inspectorate (CTI) in the second quarter,
in which it established that one of their most common shortcomings is that they fail to inform relatives about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
According to its spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, CTI imposed 41 fines totalling 73,000 Czech crowns
on funeral services for this very reason.
Inspectors discovered deficiencies in 47 of a total of 95 controls.
Besides the failure to inform about prices and issue confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices that differed from those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and in one case an officially unverified measuring instrument was used.
As a result, the Inspectorate banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 Czech crowns,
including mainly urn containers, covers for candles and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
"Given that this is an area of services where laws and regulations are being breached on a regular basis, these checks will continue into the next quarter of the year," said Fröhlich.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who is actually buying records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement derives from actual data.
According to YouGov, the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item, but by midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54, apparently.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."
So, let's take a look.
While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation.
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I suppose I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.
He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
He has, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.
From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
That may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I have that, and I think a lot of people do.
It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.
"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.
That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.
More of the product side, less of the music.
We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."
That's younger people, not older ones, late teens who are just getting into it.
Fopp, which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop, rather than noodling jazz, is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale.
She is window-shopping, rather than on a spending spree.
She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh.
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classics, the essential records for any average collection.
Nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration, some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is pure "art vinyl."
But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying the sharks, says record goes to a female thought to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five metres in length
French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
He thought he was going to die.
Ulč resurrected himself and volleyball in Ústí.
"Since March, I was able to train normally," he said at the start of summer training having worked his way to full strength.
What was wrong with you?
I had double pulmonary embolism and related heart problems.
When I competed at the Universiade in Korea, I had no idea that there was something wrong with my blood.
Do you think this was caused by the long-haul flight to Asia?
I had a blood clot in my calf for two years, and I had no idea.
It did hurt but nobody found anything wrong with it.
Then the clot moved upwards.
I have a damaged vein in my calf, which will continue to hurt, especially when it is worked or when the weather changes.
This does not present a limitation for me in any way - it is rather an aesthetic thing.
Were you scared for your life?
I was.
Last year at a summer tournament in Dřevěnice, I could not move at all, and I had no idea that I had a blood clot.
In the evening, I vomited blood.
The doctors were telling me It was something completely different, and I felt K.O. for another five days.
In Dřevěnice, I really thought I was going to die. My girlfriend and my family also thought so.
I already started picturing myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to experience it; it can only go upwards from here.
I know now that I have some problems with my blood, and I will have to watch it when I fly somewhere in the future.
On the other hand, I am not limited in any way.
Just when I was ready to return to preparation in Příbram last year, I started having problems with my heart.
Everything is fine now.
To play again, I have been working on my fitness by my own at home since March.
Fingers crossed, I feel physically in a better shape than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I am excited - the team looks strong, and I know most of the guys.
I also look forward to meeting the two foreigners who will be joining the team.
I hope we will get on on a personal level, and we can work well together.
Do you think you will be able to provide Ústí with a much needed boost?
It had a reputation of being an underdog, but every season is different.
Two years ago, Brno was eighth, and now it finished second.
Ústí has a completely new team, only a few players remain.
It came in last in the Extraliga, so there is plenty of room for improvement.
What we make of it is up to us.
We will see after the first rounds, who will be the underdog.
Is the manager, Mr Brom a guarantee for success?
He is very experienced and he has seen a lot, and he certainly wants to lift the team from the last place.
However, my arrival had nothing to do with his; I agreed to join earlier.
There were other managers in the running, I am great friends with one of them and there was an agreement that he will join here.
I do not want to mention the name.
In the end, they hired Mr Brom and I am happy about the decision.
He has a great reputation, he manged some very good teams, his experience spans several decades and he was a successful player himself.
He will move us up in the rankings.
Where do you come in?
This team will fight, which is also my forte.
I enjoy fighting, encouraging others to give their best, and I am looking forward to the challenge of playing in a team which does not belong to the very top.
I played for Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a much bigger challenge than to play for the sixth team because here we have to start from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, the Australian player Boehm is already training with Ústí.
What does he look like?
As it happens, I know him because we played against each other in the group at the Universiade.
We spoke to each other there a couple of times, and we also hung out together after matches, so we had a chance to get to know each other.
We beat them 3:1, I reminded him right at the beginning of summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he is a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze are also expected to join.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to the American, he seems to be a nice guy. I have no idea, whether the Brazilian guy can speak English.
You got in touch with the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I am a setter, which means my role is to create opportunities, so I should be communicating with everyone.
I did some research on the internet to see what kind of player he is, and I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty good - he is tall and jumps a lot.
We exchanged a couple of messages on Facebook, he is a bit of a comedian, I think he will fit in well with the team.
How are you looking forward to being the number one setter?
I would not have accepted anything else.
After all, I will be twenty-four soon and I don't like being a substitute.
I prefer to be at the centre of things, leading the team rather than let somebody else lead.
I guess I would not want to go on playing full-time if I were to be the second setter. If you cannot give your best, it is not worth much.
How often have you been the first setter?
Six months in Příbram, when Kust, the captain was not in form, got injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
Since then, we climbed up the rankings and I played all the time.
In Brno, where I started, I alternated between first and second setter.
I had a great year at Staré Město, and I could choose from a range of offers and I decided to go for Příbram.
While there, Budějovice has shown interest in me, I decided to stay, but I could not finish the season because of the embolism episode.
This is a new beginning.
Gold medal No 22
The short individual medley remains Phelps' domain.
"It is great to be able to get back on the podium and to hear the national anthem, it feels amazing," smiled Phelps while his eyes welled up with tears.
His mother together with his fiancée cheered him on, while his son Boomer slept peacefully sporting a pair of ear defenders.
I am experiencing an incredible week at the end of my career.
It is crazy - I started swimming competitively twenty years ago and in a few hours it will be all over, he said emotively.
Silver was won by Janpan's Kosuke Hagino, who won the long individual medley.
China's Wang Shun won the bronze, having won bronze in this event at last year's World Championships.
Following in the footsteps of Alu Oerter (discus throw) and Carl Lewis (long jump), Michael Phelps becomes the third athlete in Olympic history to win four consecutive individual titles in the same event.
Brazil's Thiago Pereira and his compatriot, Ryan Lochte kept pace with Lochte for most of the race,
but neither man could live with him on the freestyle leg of the race as they dropped out of the medals completely.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his historic medal collection.
Shortly after the medal presentation ceremony for the individual medley he advanced into the 100m butterfly final.
Phelps' historic achievement could not be overshadowed even by his compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the 100m and 200m backstroke titles in Rio.
In the final, he took gold over Mitch Larkin of Australia, who finished 0.37 seconds behind him and Russia's Evgeny Rylov, who came in third.
While Murphy only finished fifth in 200m backstroke at last year's World Championships, he became the undisputed backstroke king at the Rio Olympics.
He unseated Mitch Larkin from the throne, who won a similar double at last year's World Championship.
This is the first time he won a gold medal at the Olympic games.
American Simone Manuel and Canada's Penny Oleksiak claimed joint gold in the women's 100m freestyle final.
While for the sixteen-year-old Penny Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Simon Manuel, it was the second medal after having earned silver in the relay.
Manuel became the first black female swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal.
I hope I can inspire other people to realise they can do this too.
I dedicate this medal to all those who will follow in my footsteps loving this sport, said the visibly moved Manuel.
Third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who also won gold in 100m butterfly in a world record time and silver in 200m freestyle.
The world record holder, Australia's Cate Cambell only finished sixth.
Japan's Rie Kaneto won the women's 200m breaststroke. It is the first Olympic medal for the twenty seven-year-old.
Her best result so far was a fourth place in this event at the 2013 World Championships.
This was the second silver medal for Russia's Yulia Efimova, who faced hostility from her fellow competitors and the crowd because of her doping past.
I have made one big mistake.
I won my appeal and I do not see why I have to keep answering these questions all the time.
I feel very tired, said the Russian swimmer.
She had to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to compete at the Rio games.
They have considered my appeal, and I have won.
If somebody disagrees or has a different opinion, I suggest they contact CAS directly, she added.
This is disappointing, we could have won.
And a start at midnight?
Something unheard of.
It was a strange day for the Czechs.
They only found out less than an hour before the match who they will be playing against.
They had to master the tactical preparation at a lighting speed.
And then, in an unusual time, the match started on the small court number 1.
After a dismal start to the first set, they closed on their opponents only to fail to bring the set home at 19:19.
In the second, they clearly improved and levelled, but lost the decisive tiebreaker.
The 10:15 defeat was mainly down to a number of poor serves and meant the pair crashed out of the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermannová said.
What is your view of the match?
I had a slow start, but then we managed to get into the match and play really well.
At the end, my usually reliable return deserted me.
We lost that set, which was crucial.
We started the next set well with a changed defence strategy, we served well and dominated the court.
In the tiebreaker, there were too many poor serves, which tipped the scales to our detriment.
It was disappointing because we could have beaten the Russians.
Shame about the dismal start to the first set.
We were able to close on, but we lost the crucial points.
The second set was great and the third was decided by serves.
We made too many mistakes.
We gifted them five points and these five points would have made the difference. This was crucial.
It is a shame, because the match with the Russians was winnable.
How did you like playing on the small court number 1?
It was reminiscent of playing on side courts in China,
but the setting and atmosphere were different.
It took place at one in the morning in dead silence. There was no music, no nothing.
This was quite a change compared with the centre court.
We would have not chosen this deliberately, but it was not down to us.
How did you prepare for the match, having found out the names of your opponents one hour before the match?
It was strange.
We started to warm up for the match not knowing who we will be playing against. As a result, we could not prepare tactically for the match in contrast to the other teams.
But Simon (their coach Simon Nausch) prepared us tactically for nearly every eventuality.
He had prepared a lot of papers with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared in this respect.
Do you recall ever having to start a match at midnight?
I don't think so.
We played at half past ten, but not at midnight.
Russia's Birlova blocks a ball in the preliminary round play-off at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková a Barbora Hermannová embrace during the preliminary round play-off at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Given that our last two matches in the group started at ten, we have already adjusted our routine to this later start.
This was still about two hours later.
It is strange, but I cannot think of any other sport where athletes are required to give their best at midnight.
On the other hand, I think we prepared as well as we could.
We knew about it, but it is not common and probably and it will hardly become my favourite time to play.
How do you rate your Olympic experience?
As our goal was to advance from the group, we can say
that we have achieved that,
but now, after the match I am sad.
I'll sleep on it and from tomorrow, I will only remember the positive aspects of the Olympic tournament.
Big brother is here in the form of the first spying SIM.
There is no escape.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM card from one of the local operators.
This does not only include tourists but also individuals with long-term visas who e.g. work in Thailand or who got married there.
According to the Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith there will be no exceptions.
The Thai national telecoms regulator presented the plan to sell SIM cards specifically designed for foreigners in early August.
The authorities intend to implement the new measures, which will allow them to track their location within six months.
According to Mr Tantasitha, this is aimed at protecting national security, as it will help authorities to solve crimes perpetrated by foreign nationals.
In addition, these so-called tourist SIM cards should also help to uncover individuals who exceed their length of stay without proper authorisation.
Retailers should start selling the new SIM cards for foreigners along SIMs for locals within six months.
The principal difference between them is in the tracking function which will be permanently enabled on SIM cards sold exclusively to individuals without a Thai passport.
It will not be possible to disable this function.
"We do not need this feature for SIM cards sold to Thais because we can always easily track them," added Tantasith.
It should be noted that in Thailand, prepaid cards are not anonymous as it is the case in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires a proof of identity.
On the other hand, one of the operators used to supply tourists with free starter SIMs at airports.
These were completely anonymous.
Other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also mulling to follow the Thai example and introduce similar measures.
While the SIM registration is compulsory, under current legislation, they are not free to track foreigners.
The planned measures do not mean, however, that foreigners are under any obligation to purchase SIM from a local operator upon arrival to the country.
They are free to use the roaming services offered by their existing SIM cards and escape the watchful eye of the Thai authorities.
This is because the operators in the destination country only know the relevant network information. Once a SIM connects to the network,
they know the telephone number, but not the owner information.
Given that the roaming charges are so much higher than the tariffs of local operators, it is highly likely that most tourists will eventually cave in and buy a local SIM.
The authorities' efforts to track the movements of foreigners, have been the subject of sharp criticism by expat groups living in Thailand.
Tantasith has tried to calm the situation with respect to privacy protection by comparing this with the obligation to provide information about the residential address in immigration documents.
Police will need to get a court order if they wanted to track the movements of a concrete individual.
Any abuse of the system will lead to a yet unspecified punishment.
"It would be a criminal offence for a service provider to track the SIM location without a court order," added Tantasith.
In addition, the system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While at present, telephone numbers are only recycled 90 days after the SIM has last connected to the network, this could be now reduced to fifteen days after departure from Thailand.
Luxury flat in a new development in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you opt for a flat in a new development?
We were looking for a worry-free flat with a property manager looking after the property.
Among our must-have features was ample parking and a lift, which basically ruled out older buildings.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, rocking floors, high energy consumption, etc.
We also wanted a large terrace, which older buildings do not tend to have.
You will find more about other interesting properties we visited in the magazine "Moderní byt" [modern flat].
The entire interior was designed by the architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Polaková from the interior design studio Artigo.
Why did not choose them?
Would you recommend this approach to everyone?
We would recommend using the services of an architect to anyone who is designing a flat from the scratch, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the actual interior design: designers have a much better idea about the range of available materials, and they are able to make it all work based on the wishes of the client.
We have already worked with Lenka Langerová on our flat in the mountains based on a recommendation from another client and because everything worked well we decided to approach her to work on the reconstruction of our new flat in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous entertaining-living space with adequate facilities for a family of four, conceived as a modern yet not impersonal interior.
The priority was to create a visual and functional link between the flat and the terraces and to implement smart home features.
Not least it was also important to safeguard the quality of execution.
Did you leave everything to the experts or did you have a say in the final look of the interior?
We approved all designs including technical drawings but the designs were always created by the architects.
At the beginning, we specified what we expect from design, and we have shown the architects some elements, such as carpets or paintings which we wanted to see integrated into the design.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech paintings, including the works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund helped the architects to get a feel for our taste.
The combination of black, white and nutwood was the brainchild of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, flooring, lighting, carpets, fabrics, art, etc. We then used visualisations to make sure everything worked well together.

Did you encounter any complications during the realisation phase, which forced you to abandon some of the original ideas or come up with new ones?
Perhaps only at the beginning of the project, when we arrived at the construction site and were able for the first time to get to our floor only to find out that the views we envisaged will be blocked by surrounding buildings.
This forced us to change the layout plans literally overnight.
You have used granite on kitchen countertops and fireplace tiling.
The interior is dominated by wood surfaces complemented by leather used e.g. on dining chairs and bar stools Norma from Arper.
How would you characterise the interior?
Are you planning any changes or is there something you wish you would have done differently?
I think it is a modern, airy interior, which serves its purpose.
We do not plan any changes; most changes took place after we moved in in the form of shielding and fitting solutions for the terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint concerns the nutwood flooring which is too susceptible to damage in a household with a dog.
Comments by the architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, who implemented the project
The flat is on the top floor of a new development, which made it possible to come up with a completely new layout and several other modifications.
An important element of the interior was the use of daylighting systems in the ceiling of the hall and the master WC,
to channel natural light to the darker areas of the flat.
Direct access from the master bathroom to the roof terrace and the swimming pool from USSPA is one of the adjustments, which was very beneficial for the functionality of the apartment as a whole.
It also includes a swimming pool and a hot tub.
You are not as negative as the French, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You are from France.
Where have you lived before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
So I moved around quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, thanks to which I managed to get a job with a magazine.
Why did you then decide to move in another country?
I started to feel suffocated in France.
I just did not want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
The French people came across as overly negative.
People in France are generally quite negative, but it has become much worse lately.
It is interesting that you mention negativity.
There are many people you say this about the Czechs.
Believe me, you are not as negative as the French.
Some people who come to France as tourists, for example, may not be so aware of it.
But I had enough.
Everybody keeps talking about money, for example.
People feel that they do not have enough money, despite the fact that the minimum wage in France is EUR 1,500, which in my view is quite a lot.
Now there is another problem with behaviour towards Muslims,
which is beyond me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbour started to look down on me just because I am a Muslim.
As if I was some kind of evil.
As a result, I no longer felt welcome in France,
even though the rest of my family stayed there.
So you decided to move to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job in a different country, and I found an opening at Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I did not know anything about Prague at the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic as my dad told me about what happened in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
I have now been living here for three years, and I cannot imagine living anywhere else.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of the different atmosphere.
Maybe it is because I do not speak Czech, so I cannot catch some of the negative reactions or insults, but I feel that people have more freedom here.
I feel I can do anything, dress in any way I like, and nobody will judge me.
In France, people keep starring at you in an unpleasant way because you dress differently, etc.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
In my opinion, locals do not seem to care much about these things.
Where do you work now?
After I left Air France, I worked for a while for a travel website.
After that I founded a website together with a friend, which can be used by people to find and offer shared accommodation.
We currently only operate in Prague but we would like to expand to cover the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends, who are half Czech, and two female friends who are Czech.
I must say that Czechs tend to keep their distance at first.
They do not let just anyone get too close,
which is quite different where I grew up.
In the south, everybody is hugging and kissing each other on the cheek.
It is different here, but I understand that this is a cultural thing, so I try to adjust.
You mentioned that you do not speak Czech.
Does the language barrier present a problem for you?
Quite the contrary, I find it is really easy here in Prague because virtually everyone speaks English here.
Even in convenience stores and supermarkets.
I would like to learn Czech, but I do not have time
and because it is relatively easy to communicate in English, I do not have the incentive to learn the language quickly.
Every time when I have a problem, somebody comes along who can help me.
Did you come across some negative reactions?
Maybe because you are a Muslim?
By and large, I did not.
Maybe it is also because I work in an international environment which is more tolerant.
I can think of one experience though.
My supervisor, wo was Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something along the lines of:
While I found that comment a bit offensive,
I never had anybody having a problem with me because of me being a Muslim.
A colleague once warned me, however, about anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me to avoid the city centre because they would only be hurling insults at me.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
What do you think about the current situation?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen here in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
The problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not imagine that something like that could happen in France.
And this does not only concern Muslims.
What is more, Islam does not condone violence at all.
In my view, people who kill other people are not Muslims.
According to the Quran, no human can kill another human. Only God can kill.
What do you think about terrorists using your faith to justify their actions?
It is tough.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I should not feel like that at all.
I try not to follow the news about violence too much but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologise for something that is really not my fault.
I am a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met on náměstí Jiřího z Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, along with Christians demonstrated here against violence.
Did you know about it?
No, I was not aware of it.
But I understand why people feel the need to show that they are against violence.
I do not think that they have to do something like this.
Why should they feel guilty for something they did not cause?
Do you come across other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They tend to be a bit more religious than I am, so we sometimes have fierce discussions about Islam, because we see Islam quite differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education system, whereas they have been taught Islam in school.
We have different attitudes, but we have respect for one another.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate position of women.
What do you think about it?
I definitely do not feel subordinate.
Quite the contrary.
I am a woman and I am strong.
Does it have anything to do with the fact that you do not cover your head
and wear a hijab for example?
It has something to do with how I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a devoted Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she does not wear a headscarf.
I was always taught that faith is a purely personal matter.
It depends on how one interprets it.
When you read the Quran, you should make up your own mind.
When I read a passage in the Quran which says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of the others, I said to myself,
On the other hand, I would wear headscarf if I travelled to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where headscarves are mandatory.
Do you plan to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I have never felt so good anywhere else.
I thought for a while about Poland, but I feel great in Prague.
I could even imagine raising my children here.
In my view, Prague is an ideal city.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians demonstrated against violence.
The wind in Rio swept the yachtswoman Kozelská-Fenclová closer to the final.
The Czech sailor, Veronika Kozelská-Fenclová did well in Friday's two heats on the race course in Rio di Janiero.
In the Laser Radial Class, she moved to the tenth place before the final two heats.
This would guarantee the Czech yachtswoman a place in the final.
You can collect parcels like Pokémon.
They want to compete with delivery services.
The brains behind the idea to use already scheduled journeys to transport packages are the TV director Matěj Liška and Marek Greger, a manager of a music club in Prague.
They used the idea to create three apps with different geographical reach.
We have launched the domestic delivery services app "Převezu" in May.
At this point, it contains one thousand cities, and we will continue to expand the network.
We want to learn the business in the Czech Republic first before we start focusing more on other countries, said the forty one-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the app "Převezu" work and who can benefit from it?
You can download the app for free and register.
Then you can enter your route and information about the size of the package you can transport and the price.
On the same day, someone else may be looking to deliver something.
If both sides agree on the route and the time of delivery, the app matches them together and they both receive a notification,
Next a chat window opens, where the two sides can arrange the handover/pick up.
How many people do you think will have to register to match every package with a courier?
I am not in the position to estimate how many registered users and journeys there have to be to balance supply and demand to ensure optimal coverage.
It is already working well on the main routes but this is much easier than it would be, say, on the road between villages.
The more people, the bigger the potential to offer a fast and accurate delivery,
It takes time for people to trust the system as they realise that nobody will run away with their parcel.
Have you not dealt with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
We currently have roughly five to six thousand people who deliver parcels.
We consider this to be a success and believe that it will snowball from here.
Is there not a risk that the sender may have to wait too long?
We hope to be competitive with the large conglomerates not least because we are able to deliver the package the same day and for a fraction of the price.
Large companies charge several thousand Czech crowns for delivery within two hours.
With us, you pay one hundred Czech crowns or less because someone is going to your destination anyway.
Should traditional carriers worry about potentially losing customers in the future?
We hope that this will be the case.
The market has a huge potential, there is a range of multinational carriers operating here, making money. When the large retail chains first came here, everybody rushed to shop there only to find out later that the quality does not necessarily reflect the price they are paying for the products.
Nobody likes to find a note in their mailbox advising them to pick up their parcel at the post office branch after 19:00,
when you needed the parcel six hours ago and waited at home because it was important.
We want better, faster and more customer-friendly service that will not annoy people and will send a signal to the competition to try harder.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška is a TV director.
In 2014, they started to prepare the application Shippansee LTD, which uses previously scheduled routes between world capitals, in particular, by air to transport packages.
In 2015, they hired a company to work on the project, which created apps, e.g. for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
It took 9 months to develop the app, and they launched to the market in March 2016.
The development of the "Převezu" app started in December last year, and it was released in May this year.
It is a localised version of the Shippansee app adapted to the Czech market.
They have been developing the apps "Mesíkem" and "Mesíkem Profi" since January this year and made them available to users at the end of July 2016.
They intended from the very start to merge all these apps into one.
They want to fine-tune the app in the Czech Republic and then focus on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
Sharing economy has become a buzzword lately, with Airbnb and Uber being the leading companies advancing this type of service.
Are you not concerned that the boundary between sharing and grey economy is blurred in this particular field?
It is the same thing, just a different product.
We are aware that if we succeed as a business, and we continue to grow we will be criticised for being part of the grey economy.
While our service will help people to make money on the one hand and save money on the other, it is not our intention to evade the tax authorities or tax inspections.
Any user, who makes money, will be advised about the need to pay taxes on the income generated.
What does make you believe that this service has such a big potential?
The sender will save money and the courier will lower the cost of his journey.
This is the powerful idea that connects the two sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like to bring people together.
People will be happy that they could help someone, and they will be able to share stories with others.
Maybe someone will bring you your misplaced glasses, keys or medication.
In my view, people miss the personal touch. We say about this app that it is a service by the people for the people.
How can you guarantee that the courier will not take the parcel and run away?
Upon registering, each user will be required to submit a scan of his or her ID card and provide bank, credit or debit card details.
These are channels that lend credibility to the service and its users.
Couriers also collect stars based on the sender reviews.
We will also be offering insurance, the details of which are currently being fine-tuned.
If the consignment is uninsured, the courier is liable for its loss or damage. However, he is not liable for its content under the criminal law, if he was unaware that there was something illegal inside the package.
If the courier is stopped by the police who searches the trunk of his car and finds an AK-47 or ten kilos of hashish in the closed package, the sender will be criminally liable.
Is there not a risk that the sensitive data from the database could be misused?
If necessary, those registered can be traced by the administrative authority, which alone will be able to access it; even we will not have access to the data, which are protected from misuse.
How much can couriers earn after they have successfully delivered the package?
Couriers set their prices, and they receive the full amount they ask for.
The sender will be charged a few percentage points extra for arranging the contact between the two sides.
This represents our profit, but it is only a few percentage points because we want to increase the volume.
It is also not possible to claim that the courier has not delivered a package when this is not the case; the handover and deliver is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions
as regards the size or content of the parcel?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes - the smallest is about butter size, the medium is like a tray of eggs and the large is the size of a crate of beer.
There are no other restrictions and if someone has sufficient room in their car, they may transport a fridge.
The sender also has the option to take a picture of the parcel through the app, so that the courier can see what the job in hand is.
Senders are not even required to package the item, if they do not wish to hide the package content.
All you have to do is hand the forgotten sweatshirt to the courier.
Whose idea was it and how long did it take to launch the service?
A friend came up with the idea more than two years ago, and I did not pay much attention to it back then.
Then he showed me a demo of the app with multinational scope that was mainly aimed at airline passengers.
I told him that I would not be looking for an investor, because I wanted to invest my own savings into the project.
We spent the next year developing the app, so we decided to establish Shippansee LTD in London to enhance the credibility of the whole product.
Nevertheless, this is not an area you are now focusing on as a matter of priority.
No, we focus our marketing effort on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to fine-tune the app to eliminate any bugs and there are still areas we want to improve.
We want to respond to the feedback from our customers, and we are not that focused on foreign markets at present.
We know we are in this for the long haul, and we are not trying to rush things through as we want to create a really good product for the people.
Shippansee LTD was the first and the most expensive app; the other two were in a way just an upgrade.
"Převezu" was created when we decided that the national segment can potentially be much more interesting and if nothing else we will use our experience in the Czech Republic to learn.
The third app, "Mesíkem" is a local app for cities.
Nevertheless, you can use it to send a parcel to an address on the other side of the world.
It works for the sender the same way as "Převezu", the difference being that as a courier, you see the consignments as dots on the map which are the closest to you thanks to GPS on their mobile phone.
"Mesíkem Profi" is an app for couriers who want to pursue this professionally.
Does this mean that people can literally pick up parcels around the town as their second job?
Absolutely, in Prague, this app could be downloaded by taxi drivers, students, mothers on maternity leave or anyone who wants to make some cash on their way to work.
They could, in essence, collect it like they do collect Pokémons these days.
The courier can see where there are jobs available, he or she can click on it and find out when the package is due for delivery, and then goes ahead and delivers the package.
We designed the service to be much cheaper than the competition.
We are currently working on a web interface, which will be crucial for companies to send packages; they will be able to fill in the information online and create the dots on the map.
We will then be in the position to invoice them, e.g. every month for using the service.
Do you now devote all your time to the project?
It keeps us very busy, and we still have our day jobs to be able to fund and develop the project.
We do not have a multinational investor with deep pockets backing us. We are two regular guys - one who had a great idea and another who jumped on the bandwagon with additional suggestions and ideas.
We are now looking for a dedicated and resourceful investor who would have the courage to develop the product beyond the Czech market and to create a global market leader comparable with AirBnB and Uber.
The story-scope of Titanfall 2 is expected to deliver nearly forgotten diversity.
According to the information provided, the sequel and the single player campaign are expected to be much more diverse than the Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours, and the content is based on the concept of net battles introduced by its predecessor.
Players can enjoy the freedom of movement, which next to running includes the option to use a fighting Titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game contains levels focused on flexibility in movement.
They are reminiscent of platform games and puzzles.
To clear them, it is key to utilise, e.g. double jumps, wall runs and rope sliding.
In addition, players will have to do damage to their enemies.
There will also be maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one of them, it will be, for example, possible to move platforms up and down and open massive doors,
and thus change the look of the battlefield.
The pace of the gameplay should, therefore, move between fierce action and quieter moments to explore the unknown planet.
Players will be in control of a foot soldier Jack Cooper, who is dreaming about becoming a professional pilot.
At the start of the campaign, Cooper and captain Lastimosa crash on an alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy troops.
The local wildlife will also not give them a break.
What is more, Lastimosa is fatally wounded in the crash and Cooper, therefore, has to revive the captain's Titan.
His dream of becoming a pilot comes true earlier than he thought.
The first step will be to steal the battery necessary to repair the robot.
Important will also be the conversations Cooper has with the Titan.
These will serve as a source of information for the players to find out about the soldier's past, while at the same time, the impersonal communication style of the robot will produce some laughs.
For example, when the Titan dryly lists all the injuries that Cooper could suffer as a result of a planned jump.
The Polygon server was first to report on the Titanfall 2 campaign.
We will be able to judge the game for ourselves in two months, and we at Bonusweb will be reporting on our first impressions of the game.
Titanfall 2 will be released on 28 October for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
THQ brand will be resurrected but the original publishing house is dead.
The Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to Nordic THQ.
Following the collapse of the publishing house THQ, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company name and logo.
As a result, Nordic was able to release e.g. Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or the Red Faction Collection.
There are another 23 games being created for the publishing house, which is yet to reveal 13 of them.
Thirty years ago, at a time when I was about to retire, my wife of thirty years started an affair with our neighbour, who was twenty years her junior.
I knew about it from the start - she was first pursuing him quite openly before they got together.
He was quite a big guy, probably her type as she dated a similar type before me.
She was head over heels in love with him.
In those first days, her voice even changed; she suddenly had such a girly, infatuated voice.
However, when I told her that I knew what was going on she denied it.
I was watching the whole thing.
He used to arrive at home from work at half past three and she always left at three to go shopping.
She tried to see him at least once every day.
Later, I figured out that they were meeting in the house where he lived, in the laundry room.
There were many times I knew that they were at that very moment.
I managed to get the keys and I was determined to catch them there inflagranti.
I do not know why, but in the end, I always stayed at home.
I was incapable of taking the decisive step and going there.
You may find if funny, but I am convinced that my wife was controlling me with her mind.
I think that she found out early on that she can control me to make me do what she wanted.
And I actually did it.
Maybe I am just a looser.
At the same time, my other neighbours also hinted that they knew about the affair.
I was a fool because I never asked them what I should do.
I was scared that if push came to shove, things would get really bad.
Only my daughter thought that this may have an impact on everyone in the family.
As the time passed, I kept procrastinating.
Once I went to see him in his flat, and I told him that I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him that I received an anonymous letter accusing him of having an affair with my wife, and that I was inclined to believe it.
I asked him what he had to say.
He stood there, shrugged and said nothing.
At the time, I also bumped into his wife on her way from the shops.
I told her about it, but she did not believe it.
She did not react and did not say anything.
Nobody said anything to me at the time.
I am a type of person who does not go out much, and I always found it difficult to meet new people, let alone women.
Hence, I was not really contemplating a divorce.
I still hoped that it would end one day.
I told myself that I would forgive her everything and life would go on.
This is not how it went down,
and I have never really come to terms with it.
I am still keeping those feelings inside.
I used to show her how I felt, but in the end, I stopped to keep the peace.
He still lives next door, and I still live with her,
the only difference being that she is more of a housekeeper than my wife.
She always did everything at home - she did the cooking, washing, cleaning up.
She has always been a hard worker.
I think she wanted to make sure that I do not have another reason to complain.
I can also say that she is kind.
Sometimes I would like to touch and hug her but she would not let me.
We keep going together for walks and shopping, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
She said to me once that she never loved me.
She said that she always had been fond of me, but she never loved me.
I can see that she still loves him, she worships him like a god.
I am tired of such a life.
Back when it all started, and I was taking it very badly, I once said to her that I no longer wanted to live and asked how she would feel if I ended it.
I wanted to know whether she would agree with it.
All I wanted to hear is
She thought about it for a while and then she said:
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation, which would act as a bridge between the French state and France's Muslims.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, and the government is calling on the Muslim minority to help.
"If Muslims will not help the Republic to fight against those who undermine public freedoms, it will be increasingly hard for the Republic to guarantee their freedom of worship," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He wants to ensure that only clerics trained in France are allowed to practice in mosques and other places of worship.
He also wants to stop funding of mosques from abroad, because the funding is usually accompanied "imported" foreign imams who then spread radical agendas in mosques.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation, which would act as a bridge between the French state and France's Muslims.
The new institution will replace the “Foundation for Islam of France”, which was founded in 2005 by former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin
with the objective to make the financial flows between mosques and countries that that fund their construction more transparent.
It was, however, soon hit by internal divisions, and it never worked properly.
"It is a total failure," said Valls recently.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by Jean-Pierre Chevènement, the former minister of interior and defence, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are roughly 2,500 mosques and places of worship in France, of which some 120 are thought to be under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 of Imams and dozens are currently under consideration.
This week, the German police also took action against radical clerics,
who were allegedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a facility which was reportedly radicalising believers who later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
In the aftermath of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate over a new institution that would replace the largely defunct foundation ignited in France.
This urgency has been augmented by further terrorist attacks in France carried out by radicalised Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure that mosques are funded from domestic sources and to monitor imams.
It is not clear yet how the new foundation will be funded, even though a number of proposals are being considered.
One of them would be a special charge on halal food, i.e. mainly meat from animals slaughtered according to Islamic principles.
This charge would, in practice, be paid by the vendors of halal food for certification.
Part of this money would then go to the foundation.
Another option would be for French pilgrims heading to Mecca to pay a contribution of ten to twenty euros.
Every year, around 30,000 French Muslims go on this pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers trained at local universities should be permitted to practice in mosques.
This is designed to ensure that sermons are compatible with democracy.
The government is also shutting down radical mosques.
"We have shut down twenty mosques since December and other will follow," said the Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
On Friday morning, an unnamed gunman seriously injured his ex-wife in a shopping centre in Zaragoza in Northern Spain, the newspaper Independent reported.
The shooting took place after the woman and her daughter left a garage in their car.
The man was reportedly waiting in another car from which he opened fire.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the weapon on himself, the Independent reported.
The woman was taken to the hospital by her uninjured daughter, while the man in critical condition was taken there by ambulance.
The shooting took place at around 11:00 local time in the centre of the capital of the autonomous region of Aragon, not far from the local university.
The Independent is citing the Spanish news agency Europa Press, according to which the motive was likely related to unresolved issues surrounding the couple's recent divorce.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame seaweed, ginger and chilli sauce.
While summer is the time to enjoy light, easily digestible meals, we Czechs are rebels, and we are quite stubborn when it comes to our tastes.
Our al fresco restaurants like to serve grilled pork, brisket or pork knuckles.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, except perhaps for a salad or roasted vegetables here and there.
Barbecuing not only saves time and crockery, it is also a social event without anyone having to spend hours in the kitchen.
However, there are alternatives how to prepare treats, which will inject some variety into dining. Their preparation is a bit of a ritual but on the other hand, there is no need to spend hours in the kitchen baking, frying or stewing anything.
What is more, they will make you healthier.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a bit of skill will make the preparation enjoyable and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
This also applies to the even easier rice paper rolls from today's recipe,
which allows you to skip the more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
You only need to submerge the paper for a few seconds in water and the rest with regard to the filling and ingredients is up to the cook and his imagination.
All seaweed is not created the same.
The advantage of Asian cuisine these days is that the ingredients are today readily available.
Including the pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic accompaniments for fresh sushi or rolls.
You can make it at home, but the genuine pink gari ginger has unique spicy and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, which is used to make it from various types of vinegar and ginger.
All you have to do is to buy a bag of this stuff in the right size and you will have a side dish with proven antibacterial efficacy and supporting digestion and to boost immunity against coughing or the flu.
Banana leaves.
They are used primarily in Buddhist and Hindu cultures when serving and decorating dishes for a variety of ceremonial occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are widespread in many countries in Asia and South America as tools to prepare a variety of baked, boiled or fried foods, which are packed into them like in an aluminium foil.
Banana leaves also lend food a specific flavour.
They are available here in specialised stores selling exotic fruits and vegetables, pre-cut into pieces.
Only choose leaves that are bright green and healthy, i.e. without cracks and spots
The preparation of a salad made from wakame seaweed, sesame and sesame oil is similarly straight forward.
This is available frozen.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will be familiar with nori seaweed.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, which is cut, pressed and dried to prepare nori leaves, which in turn are used to prepare sushi.
Wakame − the dark green seaweed growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido − can be eaten fresh or dried and is as popular as nori.
Most people are familiar with wakame miso soup, which is said to have been used by Asian women since ancient times to recover after childbirth.
In general, this seaweed is considered to have miraculous powers.
It purifies the blood, strengthens blood circulation, it is also said to prevent the greying of hair, and it is packed with minerals.
Dried and shredded wakame is also used as a spice for seasoning rice, for example.
Fresh seaweed should be first leached in water then rinsed, plunged into boiling water and cooked for 30 seconds.
Next, they cool it in ice water, cut out the centre ribbing and processed further to prepare e.g. this popular salad.
Nevertheless, it is much easier to buy the ready-made, frozen version of the product.
All that remains is to prepare a roll with a simple vegetable filling, which is both delicious and light and full of healthy flavours.
This is such a fountain of youth.
You have to resist adding a grilled pork belly.
Healthy & light summer dishes
Asians know how to do this.
All you need is a few special ingredients and bit of skill, and you will create an interesting, fresh meal, which is a delicious combination of various flavours.
It is finished in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g cucumber 60 g wakame seaweed and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
Handful of chopped coriander, teaspoon black sesame, teaspoon sriracha chili sauce, 20 g mango and 40 g pickled gari ginger, a few pine nuts.
First, we will prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper for five seconds in the cold water.
Next, take it out and wait until it softens.
In the meantime, cook the asparagus tips briefly in hot water and cool them in cold water after roughly three minutes.
We place the vegetable filling on the softened paper and wrap it.
We will prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and cucumber, cut into fine strips, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix it thoroughly and add to the rice paper.
We place the asparagus tips on the banana leaf, add the rolls and garnish the dish with wakame seaweed, pickled ginger, a slice of mango and we sprinkle black sesame and pine nuts on the top.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.

Prison?
I would prefer if they had to drive people for free, says the taxi mafia hunter Rubeš in connection with the ground-breaking prosecution.
According to ČT, the defendants are six taxi drivers and a former official of the municipal government in Prague.
You've made a number of reports in which you uncovered the fraudulent practices of those who are in the group which is now being prosecuted.
You had to face several unpleasant skirmishes with those you have exposed.
To what extent does this news of members of this organised gang being prosecuted represent a breakthrough for you?
I did expect that this would go to court at some stage.
I am mainly curious about the verdict,
but I do not think that they should be in jail.
That is useless.
They should, in the first place, repay all the stolen money,
by having to drive people for free.
This is a somewhat strange solution.
Does it mean that you do not consider the likely punishment handed down by the court to be sufficiently effective?
I consider it sufficient that some of them are now so scared that they left the profession.
One of them is now working as a waiter, another is delivering pizza and one of them has given up completely.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate tariff?
I have a problem with custodial sentences in general.
I consider them to be an ineffective form of punishment.
It is nonsense to put somebody behind bars in a case like this.
Such people should be forced to give back to society what they have taken away.
They have been destroying our country's reputation by brazenly stealing from people for twenty-five years.
So now they should restore the country's reputation by having to drive people for free.
I cannot think of a better form of punishment.
It would work like a community service.
As others are required to collect garbage, they would get a car to drive people around Prague for free.
No, I think that in the end, they will get a suspended sentence and they will not care.
They will find another way how to defraud others.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently, at Tomáš Baťa University in Zlín.
Mr Rubeš is one of the people, who started creating videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic and the person behind many viral videos.
He works as a journalist for the online broadcaster Stream.cz, where he is involved in a number of shows. He is currently working on the Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign audiences.
This is a series of short reports, in which Rubeš advises foreign visitors which services they should be using and what they should avoid.
He has previously filmed shows with titles "Jak na to" [What to do], "Město podvodů?" [City of fraud?], "Život v luxusu" [Life in luxury], "A dost!" [Enough!] and "Praha vs. Prachy" [Prague vs money]. VUTIUM a Prometheus, Brno a Praha 2001. Fast cash
In the indictment, they are referred to as an organised group.
The police followed them for several months.
Can this group of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as a mafia-style group?
They seem to be "nice" mobsters compared to those from the Godfather.
This is more about mobsters-juniors, but they are definitely organised.
If nothing else they are watching the taxi ranks for each other.
They have Prague divided into different zones.
I have observed, for example, that those at the main railway station do not like those in Pařížská, and those in Pařížská, in turn, do not have cordial relations with drivers at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
They all are watching their taxi ranks and each group is organised in some way.
It is probably a complex network,
but there are altogether only seven defendants - six taxi drivers and one official from the municipal government who is accused of warning the drivers ahead of controls.
As you have said, this undesirable element has not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague taxi drivers do you consider to be fraudulent?
While it is only a very small percentage,
the worst of them are still roaming the streets.
I am talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries an expandable baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday, he is at the taxi rank near Charles Bridge and drives people around the city.
When I was in his taxi the last time, he wanted me to pay him three hundred Czech crowns for three kilometres.
The police has not detained him for some reason.
They only picked a few people from that large group.
The situation is very similar in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people will hardly eradicate a well-known Prague vice, which appears to be much bigger.
On the other hand, I would not say that this was a completely futile exercise.
It will help, but it will not eradicate all the evil.
Do the taxi drivers who prey on foreign tourists still frequent the same locations which you have showed in your reports, i.e. near the Charles Bridge or Pařížská?
Yes.
They continue breaking the laws and regulations from these very locations day in and day out.
This is being ignored by the Metropolitan Police and the Prague Magistrate.
This can no longer be dismissed just as "Absurdistan," this is utter indifference.
The business of the Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Still, some of them, even if it is only a small minority, will end up in court.
This is a breakthrough.
I have to ask you whether you now feel vindicated?
Vindication was not my objective. My goal has always been to make the centre of Prague a better place.
Even if I felt that we have achieved something in this regard, I will continue.
You have to keep pushing.
Even if there is only one last thief remaining, we should continue to make our best effort to catch and remove him.
You cannot be happy with that.
In reality, however, there are many more out there.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in their taxis?
I sometimes take test rides, and I have to say that the situation is still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, from the same group, and he looked surprised to see me again.
He charged me 560 Czech crowns for three kilometres, and claimed the amount was 56 crowns (he used the trick with the decimal point).
It had a receipt, so I called the police and this taxi driver was delightfully, cheeky when he kept asking the police officers when he would be paid those 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver put a sticker over the decimal on the clock to lift 357 crowns from tourists.
Is it safe to say that these fraudsters have not stopped their activities even after you have shown the faces of those who charged ridiculous amounts for a short ride?
They have an incredible cheek.
What happened to the taxi driver who demanded his 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, claiming they cannot discuss the matter any further there because he issued a receipt.
I think that this will be also an issue in court (proceedings against six taxi drivers and one former official).
On the one side, there will be a taxi driver with his receipts and on the other, the police.
In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the Magistrate is not allowed to use secret recordings from the taxi as evidence in court.
When I filmed the series about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves told me about this precedent.
Nevertheless, I always only wanted to use the footage in the reports.
Are you worried that this could effectively result in them walking free?
I hope that the judges will understand that no taxi driver can make a living charging six or ten crowns per kilometre.
You spoke about the trick with the decimal point, which the fraudsters use to scam foreign customers.
Is this still happening or are they worried to use this trick after you have reported on it?
I think that by broadcasting the report we have made this trick even more popular.
I was sitting in a taxi recently, and the taxi driver was bragging that he was the only honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that there was a black tape at the side of the taximeter clock.
When I asked him what it was, he replied:
If fines did not quite work as a deterrent, will a trial of their colleagues do the trick?
Is there something at all that could deter them from scamming people?
You said that you believed that they would always find a way how to cheat.
I do not think that there are any truly effective deterrents.
However, they could be pushed out from the taxi ranks,
either by honest taxi drivers, who should really fight more to squeeze them out.
It is my experience that the fair taxi drivers are thankfully in the majority.
Do they want to push back against those who are damaging the reputation of their services?
There is a will, but they lack the skills.
They do not quite know how to handle the situation, and they find it difficult to formulate in more certain terms what they want.
When they staged the demonstration (because of blanket restrictions proposed by the office of the Mayor of Prague Adriana Krnáčová), they did not come across as if they knew exactly what they wanted.
On the one hand, they claimed that their protest was not against Uber, that they only want the same conditions as Uber does, on the other they said they wanted more than Uber.
The result was that they completely stopped the flow of traffic in Prague, which served as the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you rate overall the approach of the Prague Magistrate to the issue of fare overcharging?
It is obvious, that the criminal police had to get involved to handle the matter.
The Magistrate did not have clout to deal with the problem.
They had a mole there who was passing on information, which means that their taxi department's efforts were futile for several years.
I hope that they will ask the official to pay for all the checks that came to nothing because of his activities, so that he realises what he has done.
I think that this is the worst thing.
I was even with him on one of these test rides as I discovered when I checked the schedule afterwards.
It has been several months since you have released the final episodes of your show.
What was the response?
I mainly heard from foreign viewers, who were our primary focus.
Whenever my friends are over from abroad, I play them the videos.
When we then go for a walk, they are surprised to find that the people from the footage are still there at Staroměstské náměstí -
especially those infamous Prague celebrities.
Seriously,
I would build a fence around them like in a museum.
Museum of communism right here on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
Yes I do.
I use taxis where I can pay by card rather than cash.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where the drivers have no chance to cheat
There are also many taxi companies which are fair.
I have only hailed a cab on a street once since then.
Once I got into the taxi, the driver said:
Bém disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were an issue already back in 2005.
The former Mayor, Pavel Bém, took a test ride disguised as an Italian tourist, and the driver immediately overcharged him by two hundred Czech crowns.
The journalist Rubeš had a worse experience.
The taxi driver charged him 820 Czech crowns for a journey from Staroměstské to Václavské náměstí, which roughly translates to 195 crowns per kilometre as the documentary makers discovered.
The Prague Magistrate has set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometre.
The footage also reveals other surprising amounts being charged: for example a two kilometre ride from Pařížská to Truhlářská tourist costing a tourist 400 crowns.
The taxi drivers hailed from the taxi rank near Karluv Most were also ripping off customers.
They charge up to 600 crowns for a 2.5 kilometre ride to Anděl.
Marble is mainly cleaned with clean water, avoiding chemicals as much as possible and the longer the better.
It is fairly easy to clean even though from time to time you need a scalpel to remove the dirt from the creases.
It is not easy and it is not fast, said the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov v Hájích.
What she does is very impressive: the tomb is enclosed in scaffolding, which she has to keep climbing up and down.
"A restorer has to be diligent, patient and not too demanding with respect to the working conditions," she said.
This is by far not her first restoration work in the Frýdlant region.
She was behind the restoration of the stone elements of the façade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant Town Hall, the statue of St. Mary Magdalene in , Zátiší, the statue of St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Pieta in Okružní ulice in Frýdlant, Marian Column in Frýdlant or Atlanta in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration work on the gravestone of Melchior of Redern, his wife Catherine and their son Christoph began already in 2011.
We are currently removing deposits of dirt and crusts from the surface of the stone elements, and securing loose stone parts against falling and movement; they may be anchored to the wall or to one another.
We are also going to treat and preserve the surface.
The tomb will once again have gold inscriptions.
"Next, the inscriptions on marble slabs will be gilded with pure gold leaf," said Věra Sobotová, the national heritage official from the Frýdlant Magistrate.
We do not have any records of the tomb ever being repaired.
A closer look has revealed interesting holes, drilled into the marble columns.
There are hundreds of years old, and they are remnants of the gravestone decoration.
It was richly decorated, but unfortunately after the raid by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, it all disappeared.
They literally stripped it bare, said Ms Sobotová.
The restorers feel quite at home in the Church of the Holy Cross.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put the tombstones, which were submerged in order, we had to restore the baptismal font, the wall paintings inside the tomb and the tomb itself now.
"We would also like to restore the stained glass in the future," said Ms Sobotová.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition as we invest every year in its repairs and maintenance.
The restoration work on the Redern family tomb will cost in total 128 thousand Czech crowns.
This will be covered by grants as the city will not invest its own funds in this phase of the restoration work.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from the regional round of the competition "Historic city of 2015", the balance of 28 thousand crowns will be contributed by the Ministry of Culture, said the Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
It was the decision of the Municipal Council to release the winnings to restore the tomb.
The views of experts on the future performance of selected foreign markets tracked by indices compared with the Czech capital market (PX) over a horizon of one month and half a year.
Markets are characterised by growth and low volatility.
Hardly anyone predicted it at the beginning of the year.
The US-based S&P 500, which went through a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high, and it has gained another 7% since the start of the year.
This seems to confirm the rule of thumb that traders should not bet against the interests of central banks, which have so far always achieved what they set out to do.
In a situation where US stocks are trading at their all-time highs, volatility is again decreasing. Volatility is currently at its lowest since 2014, when markets were growing thanks to the quantitative easing programme of the Federal Reserve and the volatility index (VIX) held steady below 12 percent.
This is hardly a surprise.
Although the Federal Reserve keeps preparing the markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and in Japan is still in full swing, and in the past week, the Bank of England also joined the party by committing to buy bonds worth 60 billion pounds over a period of six months.
A new wave of quantitative easing is thus pushing the already-low yields even lower, and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this party last?
This is, of course, the million dollar question.
There are currently no risks in sight, the world economy is going through a period of almost constant growth without any major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity markets and in China is stabilising and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we should not be surprised if US shares continued in this relatively calm mode going forward.
Shame that Juncker did not take a leaf from Klaus's book.
I am very happy that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said the European Commission President, Juncker, when he appointed the French politician (who is indeed experienced having held so many different supranational political functions that it would be hard to find a better example of so-called European elites) to be the chief Brexit negotiator for the European Commission.
Juncker's choice was a blow to any hope that it would be in the interest of the EU to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with the UK.
However, most of the British media interpreted the appointment of Barnier to be an act of war on the part of Juncker.
Barnier is a die-hard European federalist,
and he hates the UK.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was in charge of reforming the European banking law.
His view was uniquely hostile as he proved to be an unrepentant enemy of the Anglo-Saxon free-market concept and model of capitalism.
Barnier supports multilateral regulations and he co-authored the concept of so-called banking union detesting anything that comes from the City of London and pushing through heavy-handed regulation of the financial sector and services.
Michel Barnier, who will be representing Paris in a dispute with London, is likely to be a tough, relentless and ruthless negotiator.
This probably is not good news.
In this context, it is difficult not to look back at the peaceful separation of the Czechoslovak Federation, which was largely the brainchild of the Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who used his insight, skill and empathy in the negotiations.
This is why Czechs and Slovaks can be today the closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker has not taken a leaf from Vaclav Klaus's book in this regard.
It would be to the greater benefit of all of us!
Putin in the centre of a political earthquake?
The Kremlin leader dismissed his close ally and confidant Ivanov.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday sacked his chief of staff Sergey Ivanov.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno.
This was reported by the Russian media, citing a press release put out by Kremlin's press office.
Putin signalled that he has relieved Ivanov from his duties at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by the Rossiya 24 TV channel, the Russian president said that he had accommodated Ivanov's wish not serve longer than four years as chief of staff. A wish expressed apparently when he took office.
At the same time, he announced that Mr Ivanov had been appointed Special Presidential Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport.
The news of the replacement at the top of the president's office has come as a surprise. Ivanov will be replaced by his former deputy, Vajno.
Ivanov, who is 63, is considered to be one of Putin's closest allies.
Ivanov had a long career in the KGB and then the FSB and in the past he held the positions of defence minister and deputy prime minister.
Now he is also vacating the post of the chair of the president's security council.
During the meeting with Putin, Ivanov said that he was a record holder in terms of holding the position of chief of staff.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he noted that during the 25 years since the role of chief of staff was established, there were 11 people holding the position.
Neither Kvitová nor the double act of Strýcová and Šafářová will be playing in the finals.
None of Friday's matches have so far been successfully converted into a place in the final.
First to lose was Petra Kvitová, who was beaten by the Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig in three sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitová was shortly followed by the Czech double players Strýcová and Šafářová.
The pair, who defeated the Williams sisters, was close to winning the first set, but then missed two set balls and the Russians eventually won the set in a tiebreaker.
They then proceeded to lose the second set 4:6.
Czech rowing recorded some success during the morning programme in Rio: Ondřej Synek won his semifinal in single sculls by beating Chroatia's Damir Martin almost by a second despite easing a bit at the end of the race.
Today was a good day, the conditions were great, the wind had calmed down.
I tried to conserve my power as much as possible, Synek said.
In contrast, his opponents had to fight,
so this may make things easier tomorrow.
I'm not saying that it will be easy, but things are looking good, said the rower from Dukla Prague.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not follow in Synek's footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rower came in fourth in her semifinal and on Saturday, she will start in the B finals, where she will fight for seventh to twelfth place.
She will not be able to defend her gold from London.
This is the first time I failed to advance to the final at the Olympic Games.
It is disappointing, but it was a quality race and I gave it my all.
Simply put, the competition was better, said Topinková Knapková.
She fought until the end believing that she will reach the elite six in her fourth consecutive games.
She only gave up shortly before the finish line.
I knew that the race was wide open, anyone could have advanced to the final.
I was surprised by the Chinese rower and her strong finish.
I thought that I would be able to beat the Austrian to progress to the final.
Unfortunately, she delivered a performance of her lifetime, said the 2011 world champion.
The young shooter Filip Nepejchal was far outside the finals as he failed to qualify for the second time, this time in small-bore rifle prone
event in which he finished 33rd.
The Russian team performed best in the qualification.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the first place having scored 629 points and Kirill Grigoryan from the second with 628.9 points.
In comparison, Nepejchal only scored 620.5 points.
The first track and field athletes have started their campaigns, among them the Czech heptathletes Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
After the second discipline, Cachová is currently in the eleventh place, and the Czech record holder, Eliška Klučinová in the twenty-second.
Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who cleared 1.98 cm in the high jump, and Belgium's Nafissatou Thiam are currently in the lead.
Both have produced historically best results in high jump in the heptathlon.
They both tried to clear 201cm but failed.
The Germans or Russians, who is worse?
the German society has gone through a period of profound self-reflection, but the Russian society did not.
Both Eurasian nations produced dictators and regimes in the 20th century which were inhuman, brutal and horrific.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed to the 94 millions of victims of communism, as recorded in the Black Book Of Communism, whether this was related to everyday individual repressions, targeted famine, incompetent warfare or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis wiped out in an inhuman way about 6 million Jews and in total the total number of victims of the Second World War is estimated at 60 million.
Both Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities in the occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany or the USSR, it was not only a few individuals who were guilty of these atrocities. Large sways of population took part in these crimes, whether actively or passively as a result of cowardice or putting their heads in the sand.
This was not only exclusive to these two nations, we Czechs are also guilty.
In Germany, the process of denazification started in the immediate aftermath of the war, followed by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
The most important thing, however, came later.
Dad, grandpa, how could you take part in such atrocities?
How could you!
It brought real reflection and healing to the society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, elimination of poverty and welfare of the country's citizens.
They may have other (often naively-idealistic) goals, but they cannot be accused of trying to annex Alsace-Lorraine or launching military attacks against another country - motivated by revenge.
There was no period of reflection in Russia after they lost the cold war.
The window of opportunity to make any positive changes has definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when the former KGB (sic!) officer Vladimir Putin came to power.
Criminal past is often celebrated in Russia
The main policy of Putin's Russia is revenge, conquest of the lost territories and the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of the nation is not important in today's Russia.
Beat your own and others will be afraid.
I still believe that this only the product of decades of despotic regimes, that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior-destined to Asian-style (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from increasing tensions over Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border near Crimea has deteriorated.
Who benefits from the growing tensions?
After a long period of relative calm the relations between Ukraine and Russia have dropped to a new low.
The pretext for the Ukrainian side was the Crimean peninsula, which has been annexed by Russia more than two years ago, and it is now part of its territory.
Contradicting reports are coming from the two opposing sides, which we cannot independently verify, and therefore, we should ask ourselves the old question Cui bono?
According to reports from Moscow, the Ukrainian side launched terrorist attacks on Crimea, which, naturally, the Ukrainian side denies and in turn accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
The Ukrainian side responded to the information about the arrest of the members of the Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia by claiming - as they did in the Savchenko case - that they must have been abducted.
If we accepted the Ukrainian version of events, in what way would Russia benefit from a further escalation in the situation surrounding Crimea?
The simple answer is: they would not.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of even tougher sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
Ukraine disappeared from the spotlight last year, as the focus shifted mainly towards the refugee crisis.
The Ukrainian leadership has lost all credit, as the approval rating of President Poroshenko hovers around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have gone bankrupt a long ago if it were not for the generous funding from the EU and the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime desperately needs to attract attention to its country to justify requests for further financial assistance in an attempt to improve their reputation with Ukrainian voters.
President Poroshenko and other members of the executive branch want to be seen again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to Russia.
We can only hope that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia eventually realise that they are responsible not only for the lives of soldiers but also civilians on both sides and stop any hostilities in time.
Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
The annual average inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
The US security services are said to have known about Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about Russian cyber attacks came to light last month when the FBI announced that it was investigating the attack on the Democratic Party's servers.
Nevertheless, the official reports have so far failed to mention that there was any Russian involvement in the attacks.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report about the security services monitoring the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would have made it clear that the US services are doing just that, and it also could compromise the methods and sources used.
It is alleged that two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
The new Advisory Board for Cyber Security
According to the Reuters agency, the material on monitoring the Russian hacks was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, known as the Gang of Eight in the US was briefed.
It consists of the chiefs of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the democrat chairs in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Armed Services and Security Committee of the Congress.
The acting head of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile on Thursday announced that she was setting up an Advisory Board for Cyber Security to "prevent future attacks and to ensure first-class protection of the servers of the Democratic Party."
The smoked salmon from the Albert supermarket contained a dangerous parasite.
The chain apologised.
Based on the health complaint from a consumer after eating the Wild Smoked Salmon- pieces 100 g, with the use-by date of 22.11.2016, the Prague hygienists carried out inspections of the Albert stores at Václavské náměstí and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with a use-by date of 22.11.2016, the customer complained about was no longer available and sample was therefore taken from a product from the same batch with a use-by date of 11.12.2016.
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp., Anisakis simplex.
This is a common parasite present in the digestive tract of marine fish and mammals.
This worm is dangerous to humans as the larvae ingested can invade the internal organs through the stomach wall, said Šticha.
We are very sorry about the problem with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale, and we have also withdrawn all other batches of this product as a matter of precaution.
This is the responsibility of the supplier with whom are communicating, and we have also had the product tested, Barbora Vanko, the Albert spokeswoman said to Novinky.
Any customers who have purchased the product, can return it to any of our stores for a full refund.
The larvae are normally destroyed during processing i.e. during freezing or heating.
The seller was Nekton-Vrňata.
The hygienists informed the veterinary services in Prague and Central Bohemia about the dangerous product.
According to the server bezpecnostpotravin.cz, people can suffer from anisakiasis as a result of ingesting the parasite. The symptoms include stomach pains, vomiting and nausea, but some patients do not have any symptoms at all, said ČTK.
People can show symptoms on hour or up to two weeks after ingesting an infected fish which has not been sufficiently processed.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract of the host.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high or low temperatures, and are therefore killed either during heat processing or freezing.
The veterinary service has inspected the salmon at the premises of the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemia.
Three of the five examined samples tested positive for the parasite.
According to the State Veterinary Service (SVS), the shipment containing 1700 products came to the Czech Republic at the beginning of April.
It was mainly delivered to the Ahold chain of supermarkets, which received 919 packs to date.
We are currently in the process of withdrawing all unsold stocks from the stores, said the spokesman of SVS Petr Pejchal to ČTK on Friday.
Upon discovery of the positive samples, the veterinary service immediately banned the delivery of further products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old British teenager wanted to flee from Raqqa, and is reported to have been killed by a Russian air strike.
After the initial excitement and quick marriage to a jihadist, who was soon killed, came the sobering.
The caliphate paradise quickly turned into hell on earth for the British girls from which there was no escape.
The girl was, according to relatives, in touch with her sister Halima.
She called her repeatedly in the UK and confided to her that he wanted to come home.
To leave the Islamic State is like an attempt to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot indiscriminately, the Daily Telegraph quoted the lawyer of the family of the dead girl, Tasnime Akunjee.
The family was able to trace the girl to Raqqa, where she contacted them from for the last time.
This was followed by the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from their flat in East London.
They discussed how she could leave Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There hoped to reunite with the former student there.
It appears that Kadiza may have been killed before she had a chance to escape, because the house, where she was staying was levelled to the ground in an air raid in May, said ITV News.
The UK TV broadcaster added that the bomb was probably dropped by a Russian aircraft attacking the IS stronghold in Syria.
You would do anything to get your child out of the danger zone, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family lawyer.
During the week when (Kadiza) was probably planning her escape, an Austrian girl was caught when she tried to escape and according to available information, beaten to death in public.
I think that (Kadiza) interpreted it as a warning and decided to play it safe" said Akunjee according to the BBC.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana left for Syria together with her friends Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, who were both just 15 at the time, on 17 February last year.
They said at home that they were only going out.
Instead, they went to Gatwick Airport, from where they flew to Turkey, and then they crossed to the IS-held territory.
According to the family lawyer, the family did everything in their power to get Kadiza back.
You would do absolutely anything to get your child out of the danger zone, and this family did everything in their power to get their daughter back home.
This was not possible without risking that they will get caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive aspect is that the Kadiza's fate can serve as a deterrent to other girls or boys who allow themselves to be fooled by IS propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, they realised how things really are and how much the reality differs from the promises and propaganda spread by the Islamic State and they wanted to come back," said Akunjee.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is not known.
As their families have not received any communications from them for some time now they have to brace themselves that they are most likely dead.
Pay to go to jail.
In Scotland, you can go to prison without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray, the seat of the Duke of Argyll, was the principal county town of Argyll.
From the mid-18th century the courts met in the Town House on Front Street, and the ground floor below the courtroom served as the county prison.
The conditions were terrible for prisoners and unsurprisingly, there were many escape attempts and
some of which were successful.
The town representatives, therefore, decided to move the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848. It was much more prisoner-friendly as it was heated and lit by gas.
It did not stay open for long and it finally closed by the end of August 1889 for economic reasons, as by this time, the smaller county jails were expensive and inefficient to run.
Prisoner stories and ghost hunting
The prison opened its doors to the public hundred years later. Visitors can see for themselves how different the conditions were in the old building compared to the new building.
Guides in period costumes make the experience even more authentic.
Visitors can see the torture chamber where they can learn about the many forms of punishment inflicted on criminals, whether it involved breaking their fingers or branding theme with hot irons.
During the tour, tourists have the opportunity to have the warder lock them up in a cell, mainly as a photo op but also to experience for themselves what it is like to be behind bars.
Moreover, the Inveraray Jail has a reputation as one of Scotland’s most haunted locations.
It has already been the destination of numerous groups dedicated to researching paranormal activities, and the museum continues to cater for people interested in ghost hunts.
Such a night will set you back at least 300 pounds, which is roughly 9,500 Czech crowns.
Inveraray is not only a popular tourist attraction, it is also renowned for great food, surrounding scenery and history.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making, may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time, buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.
Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men, and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.
Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls must go farther, faster, up and over, in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, other times back and forth up and down the court.
They are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.
This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games.
From this, trampoline offers a respite.
The trampoliner's vector is up.
Forward motion is not the goal.
He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
It is not without competition, of course, nor without difficulty, but for the duration of a routine, there is no frantic charge toward the end, no vaulting into the distance, just the dreamy, graceful suspension of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets.
The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.
"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.
Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to crack?
For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And its streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.
But that may be changing.
"If you suffocate people and they don't have any other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.
Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that is changing as well.
"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.
"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
The result, many fear, is more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.
But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.
After making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
The latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave dueling economic speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
Instead of toning things down for a general election audience, Mr. Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.
It is true in a sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small little organization, he who called it the jayvee, totally wrong, and here's why it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe.
The coffee is still good, too.
Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine.
It even reused the lights from the old Verb.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.
There are brown-rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.
Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"A lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked," she said.
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.
He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.
"Quarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he'll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.
Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we still might take them up on it," Mr. Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other perks.
A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I've needed to smell that," he said.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Migrants want benefits
Most refugees who are flooding into Europe are economic migrants.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is how TV shows would look like if we were making them.
A group of Russian artists, who call themselves 2D Among Us, is poking fun at mother Russia.
They use Photoshop and humour to create montages, which demonstrate how famous TV shows and films would look if they were made in Russia.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chilli-powder condoms, firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals.
Previously many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom, its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
A last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Because, with a spot on Vogue's September issue, we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
With her reality television history, Jenner's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."
This sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner's Vogue cover appearance.
But dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.
She, and all of her sisters, are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine.
And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes that software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is going after ad blockers on desktop however, because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This isn't a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) was expecting up to 20 thousand visitors to visit Prague as part of Prague Pride,
the Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková said on Friday.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride started on 8 August. The event celebrates the culture and lives of the LGBT community and its members.
Last year the event attracted about 35,000 people.
"Thanks to the widespread tolerance and a range of specialised venues, Prague is among the most popular destinations for the LGBT community," said Petříčková.
According to a survey conducted by the organisers, the event's foreign visitors spend on average 3,100 Czech crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists have access to special maps of Prague with a complete list of all gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, coffee houses and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"As tourists, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, because they enjoy luxury travel and high standard of travel services and they spend far more than anyone else", said Ms Petříčková.
We are also holding the first Pride Tourism Symposium as part of the festival.
It serves as a platform for presentations by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday 14 August.
The main theme this year is love, but there are also several other thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be the traditional parade featuring floats, from Václavské náměstí to Letná.
Over the past few years, thousands of people took part in the parade, which will hold one-minute silence this year in honour of the victims of the June attack at the nightclub in Orlando, where an attacker shot and killed 49 people, mostly gay men.
Pat and Mat turn forty this year.
The die-hard handymen Pat & Mat, who are synonymous with DIY gone wrong, have been entertaining children and adults for forty years.
The pilot episode of the children's bedtime TV show premiered on 12 August 1976.
The animated TV series, which has been aired in more than hundred countries around the world, was inspired by the cartoons about two handymen Mr Ouholíček and Mr Sedlec, which the artist and the series director Lubomír Beneš created for a magazine.
Lubomír Beneš then invited the dramaturg Jiri Kubicek and fellow artist Vladimír Jiránek to work with him and together they created the short film entitled Kuťáci (The Tinkers).
They only got their current look featuring their signature yellow and red jumpers, beanie hat and a beret in 1979 when the authors started work on a new series for Slovak television at Krátký film studios in Prague.
The characters' names became Pat and Mat in 1985, when the creators started shooting the series directly for Krátký film Praha.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated films AIF in Prague and Zurich where he created further episodes.
After his death in 1995, further episodes were created by other makers, including Beneš's son Mark.
There are currently over ninety episodes with these clumsy handymen who are always good-natured and full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm despite their mishaps. They are always happy with the results of their work, which they by making a signature and "...a je to!" ["...and it's done!"].
Pat and Mat have even expanded their franchise from television screens to books, DVDs and theatres and the characters or other toys featuring the image of Pat and Mat are among the most sought-after toys in any toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and the two-year-old Harmony.
It is the end of the week, and we want to celebrate fairy tales; we have chosen one for you from the sporting world and another one from real life.
Both have a good ending.
So let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
Why is the whole country celebrating?
The two-year British girl has an identical friend and she is happy.
What do people spend most of their money on at airports?
This is a Friday overview from the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
The island state of Fiji is celebrating a historical success.
Fiji's rugby team defeated in the final of the Olympic sevens rugby tournament the team of Great Britain.
This is the first Olympic gold medal ever won by Fiji.
It took them sixty years from sending their first delegations to the Olympic Games.
The person most credited with Fiji's success is the team manager,
who happens to be somewhat ironically a Brit, Ben Ryan.
He has been managing the team since 2013 and after the final, he had a reason to celebrate in contrast to his compatriots.
"Let's play freely and lightly and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," said the manager before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated the match, and the small island state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale,
as reported by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who lost all her limbs when she was 11 months old has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
She just said, "Mummy, she's just like me," Harmonie's mother told ABC News.
"She loves to take the arms and the legs off and they love to sit next to each other without the prosthetics on."
Harmonie fell ill with meningitis B when she was 11 months old. The doctors only gave her 10% chance of survival.
I love everything about her.
She is beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
She is quite upfront, too.
I have seen her introduce herself to another child by saying, "I'm Harmonie and I have no hands".
See how happy the little girl is about her new friend.
On what do we spend most money at airports?
According to CNN, people spend most money at airports for bottled water.
Hudson 's travel essential stores recently released a list of the top 10 items sold last year at airports.
Beverages are king,
taking eight of the 10 top slots.
The ninth place is occupied by M&M Peanut king-size with coconut flavour.
Can you guess what is the last item on the top ten list?
The only non-edible item.
According to CNN it is "The Wall Street Journal."
The other popular newspapers sold at airports include:
Favourite magazines were "US Weekly," "In Touch," "The Economist."
Rowing supremos.
We are just going to win, Murray and Bond said laughing.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have dominated men's coxless pairs for seven years, and they reiterated their dominance at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
On the face of it, they looked like an odd couple when they both switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics. Since 2009, they have completely obliterated their competition.
In Thursday's finale they have recorded their 69th win in a row on the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon.
What do we do differently from other crews?
We are simply better looking, joked Murray during the Olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Honestly, we don't do a hell of a lot differently.
We train hard, really hard,
and just constantly try to refine our technique, that is our philosophy, Murray said on a more serious note.
Their domination is also remarkable given their different physique.
While Murray is almost two meters tall and weighs 100 kilos, Bond is five centimetres shorter and 15 kilos lighter.
Moreover, they have completely different personalities -
Bond is studying finance, and Murray has been involved i.a. in a charity boxing match.
This is likely the reason why they do not spend much time together outside rowing.
Eric gets in the boat with the attitude that we cannot lose.
We are just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what might go wrong, Bond admitted who clearly demonstrated during the press conference that Murray had the more dominant personality of the two.
It was Murray who answered the questions first, while Bond waited his turn.
On the water, they are destroying their competition with their quiet strength.
They keep the pace from the start, and even though they often do not lead the race at the halfway mark, they gradually go faster - nobody else can do that.
We race on a two kilometre stretch of water, and we never want to test our limits during the first kilometre of the race.
All we do is to try and race at a pace nobody else can keep up with.
We know what we have to do to win, said the thirty-four-year-old Murray.
Together with his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were part of the men's four without coxswain.
Following an unexpected defeat of the bigger crew at the Beijing Olympics, Murray and Bond decided to break out into a pair.
At the Olympic Games in London, they avenged the biggest defeat of their career, and they reiterated their supremacy in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything our coach told us. No questions asked.
This time it was more enjoyable.
We knew it would be very hard, and we had to make sure that we are mentally strong.
We know that everyone wants to knock us from our number one position.
We walk around with the target on our backs.
That is why we try to be a step ahead of the competition, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not register, there would not be a qualification agreement. Does this mean that I could move to a different hospital after a few months?
Is it even possible to work after completing the course without having to register with a specialised training programme?
I am asking because there is an opening in the field I would like to work in. The only problem is that the hospital is far away. There may be another opening in six months in a hospital much closer to me where I would like to work.
I do not know how to handle the situation during the six months or so, the asker continued.
The question is answered by Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
You are not required under any law to sign a qualification agreement with an employer - hospital.
Qualification agreement is a legal concept which is governed by the Labour Code, and may be concluded between the employee and the employer to recover costs associated with upgrading the skills and enhancing the employee's qualifications.
In the healthcare sector, there has been a long-term pushback against these agreements to ensure the mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Act No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions of obtaining and recognizing professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the medical profession of doctor, dentist, pharmacist, as amended, specifically states that participation in specialised training is considered to be an enhancement of qualification (rather than an upgrade).
This means that under the Labour Code, a qualification agreement can only be concluded if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
There is also no obligation under the law to apply for specialised training.
The law only stipulates the application requirements for being included in specialisation training.
The doctor is, however, entitled by law to practice medicine alone on the basis of completing the relevant university studies under the conditions stipulated by law (under the expert supervision of a doctor with specialist qualifications in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where professional experience in another field of specialisation can count towards specialised medical training of the doctor in question, if its content and scope relate to the relevant educational programme.
In theory, it should be possible to include time worked elsewhere, which is the case here.
Given that I do not know the details of this case, I would recommend a consultation with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (department of science and medical professions), because the Ministry of Health is required by law to provide advisory and consultancy services relating to the specialist training and its structure.
Free advice is also offered by the Czech Medical Chamber, the membership of which is compulsory for all medical professionals.
Aleppo doctors appeal to the US to intervene.
"We have seen no effort on behalf of the United States to lift the siege (of the rebel-held part of the city by government forces) or even use its influence to push the parties to protect civilians," said the letter addressed to the White House according to the AFP news agency.
"We do not need tears or sympathy or even prayers; what we desperately need is a no-fly zone over eastern Aleppo to stop the attacks, and we need international action to prevent Aleppo from being again surrounded," said the doctor.
Russian forces which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, announced that from today, military hostilities in Aleppo will stop for three hours every day to allow humanitarian convoys safe passage.
All military activity, including air strikes and artillery fire is supposed to stop from 9:00 to 12:00 CEST.
The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stephen O'Brien welcomed the initiative, but stressed that what is needed is at least a two-day truce.
According to AFP, the letter to Obama was signed by 15 of the 35 doctors working in the rebel-controlled eastern part Aleppo.
They wrote that for five years, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world has stood by and remarked how complicated Syria was, while doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation form the regime and Russia had sounded like thinly-veiled threats, said the surgeons paediatricians and other doctors.
Doctors said that last month, there were 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of which were hospitals in which they work.
What pains us most, as doctors, is choosing who will live and who will die.
Young children are sometimes brought into our emergency rooms so badly injured that we have to prioritise those with better chances,
or simply do not have the equipment to help them, said the doctors.
Two weeks ago, four newborn babies, gasping for air suffocated to death after a blast cut the oxygen supply to their incubators.
Gasping for air, their lives ended before they had really begun.
In recent weeks, forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad supported by Russian forces have seized control of the rebel-held east Aleppo with over 200,000 people still trapped inside with no food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant attack by Russian and Syrian air force, managed to break through the siege on Saturday and launch a counteroffensive.
Both sides have added reinforcements both in the city and the surrounding areas.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
Model killed by a chef.
Twelve years later, her family still has no peace!
The victim is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 in the restaurant where she worked by chef Mark Dixie, who stabbed her.
Both the victim and the killer had sex and smoked marijuana, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café and watched the painstaking investigation of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to a 34-year prison term in 2008 for the rape and murder of the model Sally.
He only confessed to assaulting the young woman to the court, and his lawyer claimed that his client had found the dead girl lying on the street already dead.
The police convicted him three years later.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting on the fateful night.
The murderer said, "He was really upset, and after he attacked her the girl started screaming."
"She even caught the attention of the taxi driver," he falsely stated.
According to his testimony, the girl defended herself as best she could, but it was in vain.
Lewis supposedly stabbed her on the street.
Dixie's version was been proven to be a lie and inculpated him.
After he confessed, Dixie spoke of his desire and lust for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt happy and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he had been with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, as Dexie himself revealed to the police.
He said that he felt adrenalin.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda added the Mirror.
Twelve years later, the family faced further acts of aggression, with vandals destroying her grave.
It has been damaged four times in the last half year.
There are cruel people going around who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter is not there anymore," Linda, the mother of the late girl, told The Mirror, describing the disappearance of the urn and ashes.
Linda waited for the vandals, but they always attacked when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Czechs are neither prudish nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it, you will find designer and luxury erotic aids,
including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It began inconspicuously about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike tour in Moravia.
However, one of them did not just bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.
"There were various kinds of moles and dolphins, and everything was green and yellow, and everything was totally different," he told me during lunch.
His friend had decided to work as a partner to Fun Factory, the German manufacturer of designer sex toys, which attracted Martin, who offered to help with marketing.
When his associate left to take up another position, he replaced him.
Today he runs the Intimity boutique in Prague's Benediktská ulice, where he sells sex toys in the way luxury handbags or shoes are often presented.
And why not?
They are also designer items.
One second, are you asking yourselves, “is this what you talk about over lunch?”
Come on, don’t be such puritans!
It was the Fun Factory store in Berlin, which was designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as the inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It opened in 2010 and was based on a completely different concept of the erotic store to what everyone is used to here.
There are no hidden displays, and everything is done in a beautiful, decent way, with the products exhibited like in a perfume store.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to get hold of a shop in Prague, where it should be and what it should be called.
Both of them liked the name Intimity.
"It's related to intimacy, and I would say it is gentle," he said.
The next step was to purchase the internet domains and look for a suitable space that would work in parallel with the various visualisations of the interior.
In the end, the variation that won saw the shop displayed as a garden of delights and a bedroom, dominated by beds.
Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio made it for us.
We found the space in 2013.
At first we thought it wasn't ideal, because it wasn't on the high street, but it was thanks to that that we came up with the name Intimity.
It's intimate.
It's in the street near to the high street, so no one can stare at the customers," commented Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to create a shop that would be different, with good, branded products, in an environment where women, who are our main customers, feel comfortable.
It should be the kind of shop they aren't ashamed to enter.
When I went to the Intimity boutique half an hour earlier, the streets were empty.
I didn't even have the feeling that I was going to a shop with sex toys.
As soon as I got to the door I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even though only women work in the shop, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, that doesn't mean that men can't step foot in it.
Gentlemen mainly go to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can not guess the right size, and they usually opt for one that is too big," chuckled Martin over the frequent mistake.
This cliche refers back to a preconception that women need big sexual aids, but it isn't true.
So although they have good intentions, men usually choose an unnecessarily big vibrator.
Likewise, men mostly pick out black underwear, while women usually tend towards pink colours.
The absolute bestseller at the moment is the appropriately named Satisfyer.
The expression on my face must have made it clear that I didn't which kind it was, as Martin immediately explained how it works.
It is a kind of contactless clitoris stimulator.
I feel the adolescent need to chuckle with admiration for the serious tone with which my comment is handled.
As if it didn't phase him at all.
At it really doesn't.
It is affordable and has perfect reviews from its users.
We couldn't believe it was so well received.
It's like the most recent innovative revolution.
The first revolution saw vibrators in the shape of a seahorse.
It paid attention to the fact that women were starting to be interested in the design of these kinds of products.
The second was the We-Vibe vibrator for couples.
It completely shattered the taboo that had been persisting among some men who saw erotic aids as competition.
"They make various kinds," he continued.
With one motor, with two motors, and with remote control.
That's the most popular category.
While making love together, both men and women can have the control in their hand and alter the intensity of the vibrations.
On the other hand, the category of penetrative vibrators was a complete washout,
at least for us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they are only used externally.
It is very popular in Western Europe, especially among younger customers.
And what about men?
It's hard to say, but it seems like this kind of concept would also work exclusively for men.
It might have to be conceived in a slightly different way, however.
The question is what to offer men," mulled Martin.
"We have aids for them too, but only to a limited extent." Masturbators are the most sold, in our case those produced by Tenga.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina but "more like a shower gel or an egg, or some kind of futuristic object.
There is a lot of focus on functionality and user experience.
It's completely different in Japan, however.
It really surprised me.
I thought the Japanese women were very picky about sex toys.
"That's the Internet reality," he explained to me.
Banal truth is quite different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are generally associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they're absolutely normal for men, but they're taboo for women. Out of interest, of the products by the Japanese brand Tenga worldwide, which can be found in the Intimity boutique, about half is sold in Japan.
In our waters
Czech men and women aren't at all prudish.
On the contrary, we are a very openminded country.
There's definitely a difference from countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years and "has some experience with both sex life and using toys.
They come for something nice and high quality, either for a fulfilling life with partner or just for themselves. To ensure that these customers keep coming back, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňek Šebelka take care to check every product to make sure it's actually functional.
We don't want to get involved in any specialism, such as bondage or latex, because we don't have a place for that, it doesn't exactly fit.
These things might dissuade the people we're trying to attract.
These are people were always too shy to go to a sex shop because they worried that they would find something like that staring them in the face.
The variety of products displayed on the shelves is really appealing.
It's also achieved through the selection of appropriate, renowned brands.
Some of them have even won awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The very first to win a prize was the aforementioned sea horse, "and that triggered change across the industry.
Manufacturers stopped using cheap materials, and instead began working a healthy approach. They started producing different designs, in various colours...
It's enjoyable to know that a Czech woman was behind the design, specifically the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised how many people buy the designer Whoop.de.doo products by Anna Marešová from us, even though they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who go directly to the Venus Balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really great job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be made differently and nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started as a school project.
Now it is a finished product that is produced in our country.
I wanted to have control over the production process and I also wanted to know with what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it is not large-scale but rather small series, which is certainly more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going against the current a bit, but it seems important to me to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It may well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything." This is how Anna described the situation later, agreeing with Martin that our society is becoming more open.
She isn't faced with a positive or negative attitude.
At most, people are embarrassed.
"But then they will start to smile." At present, Anna Marešová range includes a vibrator that can come with a personal message, and she is also planning her own lubrication gel for next year.
Next year, she plans to offer vibrating eggs and other new items.
The border of healthy sex
I'm interested in where the border lies of what's acceptable.
Is there something that Martin Ráž wouldn't sell?
That's very hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem totally abnormal to someone else, so we define ourselves by our assortment of branded products.
None of them are particularly extreme.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest request they received?
We just received an email, in which a woman requested a masturbation aid for her boyfriend, who was 28 cm long by nature.
We had to reply that we don't have anything appropriate, unfortunately.
But the question remains if someone was making fun of us," said Martin, casting me a suspicious look.
It happens from time to time...
A blow for Karel Gott.
After two cases of cancer, now Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štědrý is fighting the serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is fighting against the disease that robs people of all their memory.
"Yes, unfortunately it's true," the singer himself told Blesk, confirming the sad information.
I know about my illness, and I can handle it all given the circumstances.
"I'm taking medication to slow down the side effects of the disease," he said, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The whole branch of the family has come together to make life easier for Karel.
His wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, while Zuzana and Teresa, his daughters from his first marriage go to his house on Bílá Hora, and his son Karl, nicknamed Karlas, takes care of him.
Štědrý fought cancer twice and shared his experience with Slavík to support him in his demanding treatment.
He has completed 60 rounds of chemotherapy.
Afterwards, he was able to go back to working on the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"An astrologer predicted that I will have up to 90," Karel told Blesk.
He's a fighter.
He longs to keep singing.
"I keep repeating song lyrics so I won't forget them," Karel admitted.
The actress Květa Fialová is currently struggling against the same disease in a home.

The Chilean parliament ends the ban on abortions as the Constitutional Court passes a law.
Until now, there has been a total ban on aborting pregnancies in Chile, even for medical reasons.
"I am sorry that the lawmakers filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court, so that now there will be ten people deciding on what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and at the end of August it should get a new president, who is close to the opposition according to the AFP.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion was initiated by the current President Michelle Bachelet, and was approved by the Senate on 19 July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would appeal the law would at court, on the grounds that it violated the unborn child's right to live.
Members of parliament postponed the vote last month while the Joint Parliamentary Committee carried out an analysis.
MPs approved the draft on Wednesday and the Senate convened after them.
According to the new legislation, pregnancies can be ended in three cases: if the woman's life will be endangered, if the foetus has no hope of survival or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.
According to the Spanish paper El País, similar exceptions existed in Chile since 1931, which was before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
The total ban on abortions was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidential office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world to enforce an absolute ban on abortion.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are currently behind bars, serving prison sentences of up to 30 years for the termination of their pregnancies.
According to human rights defenders, many cases declared murder by the court are actually miscarriage.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Czechs have quickly taken to free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Czechs consume more of their tariffs abroad than at home.
They travel in Austria most often, but in the summer season the consumption of data is dominated by Croatia.
While on holiday, they have more time to browse the web, and most of the time they are not able to connect to Wi-Fi under the breach umbrellas.
Beach and bathing, smart phone in hand.
This is how a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks now that customers can use services by local operators as part of their home tariffs.
O2 recently released statistics painting this picture.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad can access more data as part of their normal rate at home.
It's no wonder, then, that in Croatia, where a minimal amount of our countrymen go in winter, consumption of data rose by as much as fifty times this summer.
Italy ranked second in the list of consumed data.
Czechs use the most minutes calling from Germany, where they go to work a lot during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, 800,000 Czechs visit Croatia each year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
People have swapped their holiday books for sharing their experiences on their mobile phones.
The record was 7 July.
"Tens of millions of photographs were transferred with the data," said Silvia Cieslarová, director of the O2 mobile department.
Although Croatia comes first in terms of the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users can be found in neighbouring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, meaning we do not have much time to browse the internet.
"Most Czechs head through Austria towards the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the operator recorded a year-on-year growth in roaming charges, the number of phone calls remains much lower.
The number of minutes used while roaming double in relation to the previous year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead over other countries.
"Calls while roaming are more likely to be made by business customers on work trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free of charge, with car parking charged at £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to compete.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
French Navy captures a huge supply of cocaine heading to Australia.
The French Navy seized a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine, worth about $256 million.
The consignment was headed to Australia.
The four-man crew was arrested during the siege, and was apparently formed of Lithuanian and Latvian people.
The yacht, which was named Afalina, sailed from South America and the police dragged it to a port in Nouméa, a metropolis in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs were going to and from, and to unmask the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for taking measures that have stopped a large number of drugs targeting Australia," said managing director Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive target for smugglers because of the high street prices of drug.
The country is also struggling with a growing number of people with drug addictions.
This haul was not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirst and need to be reminded to drink.
The problem can be found in seniors' homes, and according to Pavla Mádlová, a physician from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, the solution could be an infusion of a physiological solution under the skin with a thin needle.
However, at present this approach is only applied in health care facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in their body decreases.
"And they also lose their sense of thirst, so seniors generally drink less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," said Mádlová.
They should definitely drink two litres.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
She thinks that doctors often don't monitor this in care homes for seniors.
In hospitals, dehydration is commonly treated with infusions.
"I think subcutaneous infusions should be gradually introduced there too," she said.
In her opinion, older people can be given a two-litre bottle of physiological saline in one day.
A lack of fluids can cause malnutrition, headaches and decreased performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, and starts talking in a confused way," she added.
If ignored, it could lead to a stroke.
Blood becomes thicker and clogs the blood vessels in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, at most they should have cotton sheets.
Disposable incontinence pants may also be a problem.
"It's more demanding on the nursing staff, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin breathe," the doctor explained.
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."
A man carries out an acid attack but the court declares him not dangerous.
You never know what can happen to you.
One moment, you're at home laughing with your family, and the next your whole life is shaken to the core.
And the worst thing is that you can't do anything about it at all.
This is the fate that met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown attacker who was eventually acquitted.
Reuters reported on the story.
In December 2014, someone at knocked on the Christopheros' door.
Andreas got up to open it.
He thought that the person at the door was probably the courier who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, a terrible surprise awaited him.
A man he had never seen in his life poured acid on him without warning as soon as he opened up, saying, "That's for you, friend."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes dissolved into nothing, and I just felt an unreal pain on my skin," said Andreas.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his relatives learned terrible news there - the doctors said he had no chance to survive.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to the infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent of his face was affected, and the doctors attempted to piece it back together with skin from other parts of the patient's body.
One major complication for Christopheros was the loss of his eyelids.
Without doubt, it's the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't escape from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his suffering.
At this point, Christopheros has undergone twelve operations and is still far away from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, injuries affecting sufferers of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgical interventions and years of healing.
Even after demanding, long-term treatment, the victims still have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people do not recover, and they fight deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Peter Dziewulski, a spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker made a mistake.
In terms of the attack, Christopheros is convinced that the unknown man must have confused him with someone else.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused someone close to him.
The police investigated the case thoroughly and finally tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, the verdict was later fundamentally altered, much to the astonishment of Christopher's family.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be abolished because the man was not considered to be a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
The number attacks using corrosive substances has increased considerably over the past few years.
The UK Ministry of the Interior has announced that it plans to tackle the issue by issuing new guidelines to prosecutors concerning the classification of corrosives.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of these attacks are unwilling to give up.
They are demanding that the UK Government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people attacking their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They are also calling for tighter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in many shops since they consist of various cleaning products.
In Dubai, the biggest city in the United Arab Emirates, one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, the famous Torch skyscraper, caught fire during the night.
According to the Dubai civil defences, the inhabitants of the eighty-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai Police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
Several residents of the building claim the opposite happened, however.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Moreover, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downwards, with glowing debris falling down.
We were sleeping.
We were woken up by the alarm, people were yelling.
"We ran down the stairs, which took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," tenant George described the scene.
Other witnesses speaking to CNN estimated that the flames affected about 40 homes.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when parts of the burning building crashed down on them.
The fire was under control after about two hours, according to civil defence reports.
The cause of the outbreak is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the electricity cut out.
An extensive fire damaged the Torch skyscraper in Dubai in February 2015, ruining more than 100 apartments.
The whole building has about 680 apartments.
Nothing happened to anyone then either, as the inhabitants were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and was then the highest residential building in the world, at 352 metres tall.
Another skyscraper in Dubai took over the record the following year.
A bodybuilder had an unbelievable 14 doping substances in his body.
And he still didn't win.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample from 23-year-old Ippolita revealed a large collection of illicit aids - from steroids to diuretics and medicine for Parkinson's or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mixture did not help him, and he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year ban and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record among all the athletes ever caught.
The third league player apparently began to take steroids a year earlier, when he got addicted to bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She passionately embraced her former lover!
As soon as Lucka Vondráčková sets foot in the Czech Republic, she's on the go.
And she also attracts attention wherever she turns up.
Last time, her former lover Michal Dlouhý, who lived with her for three years, fell into her arms.
The actor was 12 years older and longed for a family.
At that time, Lucie was only 19 years old, and she definitely did not want put the brakes on her career.
They separated back then, but remain friends to this day.
They proved this at a press conference at TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, they both matched with blue colours.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes, to the point where she ended up clutching her belly.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for the photographers.
Their encounter was not a coincidence, however, as they will play a loving couple in the new Prima series Kapitán Exner.
Islamists receive a life sentence in the UK for planning an attack.
On Thursday, the British court issued life sentences to four members of the Islamist cell that called itself Three Musketeers, which planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
The four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously convicted for similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities then thought they were about to attack very soon.
Security agents found a partially finished tubular bomb in one of the men's cars, along with knives with inscriptions in Arabic meaning "infidels" and a fake gun.
This happened when the MI5 secret service officer placed a listening device in the car.
"Recent attacks have shown the panic the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped," said Sue Hemming from the prosecutor's office.
Three of the men sentenced are aged 28, 25 and 33, and they may file for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict is 38 years old, and can make the request after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed that they were innocent and that the MI5 agent planted the weapons found in the car.
The court also heard their claims, but the defendants' allegations were dismissed.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
38.3°C was recorded in Hodonín.
Tuesday's record temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius only stayed in the top spot for two days.
When 38.3 degrees Celsius was recorded in Strážnice, Hodonín, Thursday surpassed the previous peak, making it the hottest day this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Elsewhere, however, many of the temperature records set on Tuesday did not fall on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were beaten or matched in 35 of the 145 meteorological stations, which have been measuring the weather for over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations saw new record temperatures set on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice the temperature during the day on Thurday was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice, near Břeclav, the temperature on Thursday reached 37.4 degrees, surpassing the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice near Brno the current temperature of 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records was last broken in 2013, like in Strážnice.
In the west, it was about 10 degrees less.
The high temperatures on Thursday mainly occurred in the south and east of Moravia.
After Straznice, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovice, near Znojmo, and Brod nad Dyje, near Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.
On the other hand, according to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), on Thursday the highest temperatures in western and northwest Bohemia were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures started growing there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will fade erode and there could be heavy rain on Sunday.
However, temperatures in Moravia will mostly remain high on Friday, and also on Saturday in the southeast of Moravia.
China is lacking tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of the national visa policies.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends 10 billion dollars a year to support language schools and establish universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry towards foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
It isn't doing anything for Beijing, however.
The local state media has been talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.
However, the number of visitors grew by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent China's tourists came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Among other things, this is due to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, the Chinese Foreign Minister does not welcome foreigners with open arms. At least this is how Christopher Balding, Professor of Economics at Beijing University, assessed the situation in the most populous country of the world in an article for Bloomberg.
One particularly indicative example is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free entry to China, while the citizens of the others have to organise visas in advance.
As such, the Chinese offices in the US have crowds comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs 140 dollars, but if you do not want to wait in the queue for hours, you have to pay 100 dollars or more for additional services.
These kinds of restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visas reduces the visitor numbers by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans went to Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and is home to less than one percent of its population.
China often worsens this problem when it uses tourist activities to pursue its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transportation to South Korea during a rift concerning the South Korean missile defence system, the South Koreans retaliated by avoiding China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent from the previous year, whereas in Japan the same figure grew by 85 percent.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the Fed (the American Federal Reserve), up to 190 billion dollars may have left China as a result of foreign trips by Chinese people, while China only gains around 35 billion dollars a year through sales of foreign currency to incoming tourists.
According to the official figures for the development of the balance of payments, last year China had a deficit of 217 billion dollars in terms of tourism, equivalent to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in commodities trading.
This small number of tourists comes as a very painful blow to a country that has anxiously protected the flow of capital.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more a general restraint in relation to foreigners.
In many parts of China, practically nobody has heard about immigrants.
In 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in China.
In the United States, however, there are more of them living in certain cities.
Even Japan, which is not known as the crossroads of immigration, has twice as many foreign inhabitants.
Many scientific papers have shown that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
It is almost impossible to find in China, however.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the first step is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, especially India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
The number of deadly poisonous reptiles at Pilsen Zoo has increased.
At the Království jedu (Poison Kingdom) in Pilsen, visitors can now look forward to seeing the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the meantime, visitors can see the nine newly born Turkish vipers at the exhibition.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, at altitudes of up to 2000 metres.
"They grow up to a metre long," said Martin Vobruba, a spokesperson for the zoo.
The young of the other two species, the death adders and the red cobras, will gain strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still cannot say when people will see them.
"We wouldn't want to lose them," said the carer Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian death adders have been born, and are the descendants of a breeding pair from the population around Sydney.
"The specimen that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the death adders from around Perth," said Vobruba, adding that in capitivity it is necessary for death adders to hibernate for 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
There was a hundred percent success rate for a group of African spitting red cobras.
The pair in Pilsen Zoo hatched four babies out of four eggs.
"The incubation lasted for 65 days," Vobruba explained.
In the wild, this species shoots poison at distances of up to four metres.
If it gets into eyes, it can cause long-term blindness.
The young of all three species are fed with mice in the zoo.
The young of black mambas will be waiting to hatch in the garden for up to 40 days, as the eggs are stored in an incubator.
Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
Tusk testifies at the prosecutor's office again regarding Smolensk.
"He should be afraid," announced brother of the dead president and leader of the Law and Justice party Jaroslaw Kaczynski at Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me," responded Tusk, reproaching the country's current leaders for trying to pervert justice to attack his political rivals.
As he left the headquarters of the Prosecutor's Office, according to television channel TVN 4 a crowd was waiting for Donald Tusk and chanting his name. They also wished the politician good health.
Tusk thanked them for their support and assured them his conscience was clear: "I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me."
According to the prosecutors he isn't accused of anything, but there is no doubt that justice system is being used to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against its adversaries, opposition or people who do not like it, and I am afraid I belong to this group.
This was his second time at the hearing.
This was the second time the ex-prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office, and on this occasion he was questioned over mistakes during the autopsies of the Smolensk disaster victims.
In addition, there was discussion on bodies being changed in the coffins.
The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason behind it.
The reason was that they were afraid of scandal that would put pressure on Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, in spite of such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU," said Kaczyński to the Catholic television channel Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia could have affected Tusk's chances of reaching the most important seat in the Union, which Poland absolutely does not have.
Kaczynski also stated that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it might turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she didn't pay attention to it.
Tusk endured an eight-hour examination at the Prosecutor's Office on 19 April.
He didn't testified as a suspect, however, only as a witness.
However, many people considered his summons to be part of the apparent effort of the Polish government and Law and Justice leader Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him with various scandals.
In Poland the prosecutor's office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Prosecutor General.
The call for questioning came shortly after Tuska was elected the President of the European Council, which Kaczynski tried to prevent in vain, including during Merkel's visit in Warsaw.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydło protested the prolongation of Tusk's mandate at the EU summit.
In that instance Hungarian premiere Viktor Orban also left Warsaw stranded.
Burma and Senegal.
Where in the world can Czechs vote?
During the parliamentary elections this autumn, registered voters will once again be able to vote on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
The Czech Republic has opened up its embassies in these and several other countries since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This move is intended to fulfil a decree regulating the delivery of ballot papers abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has updated it, and is currently in the process of sending out reminders.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that have to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explained.
"New embassies have been established in some countries, while certain offices have been closed or the levels of representation have changed," according to the text.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which states the embassies that will be supplied with ballot papers.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than one hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot sheet to be printed.
The list of which ones is changing with the decree, however.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are now closed.
The Czech Republic also ended its representation in Bamako, Mali and Kyoto, Japan.
People will also not be able to vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
That was closed by the Czech Republic in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
New additions to the list of embassies include Nairobi in Kenya, Dakar in Senegal and Lusaka in Zambia.
Since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation in Asia through the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq and Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province.
Voting cards will also be available for voters registered at the Czech Embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose their deputies at polling stations in embassies or consulates four times.
Before each election, the state electoral committee determines which regions' candidates can be voted for abroad by ballot.
The first time was in 2002, when it was decided among the South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voting abroad could also select South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was included as well.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
Some 3800 people voted the first time 15 years ago, then about 6700 in 2006 and 8222 four years later.
The previous parliamentary elections four years ago saw 10,571 voters come to the embassies.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
I love user instructions.
One of my friends says that only quitters read user instructions.
I completely disagree.
It is a form of modern art, and often pure surrealism.
I look back with nostalgia on the distant past, when user instructions for anything were a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone only came with one sheet of paper with hieroglyphs showing how to connect certain components, all depicted through secret signs.
When an internal part broke years later, I offered the paper to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew any panel.
With a grin, he advised me what the labyrinthine paper was suitable for.
It was a well-established aid during a chronic lack of toilet paper.
He playfully found the broken wire and allowed me to listen to my dear records again.
The new age brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer which just needed a grapefruit pressed down on it required about ten pictures.
The drawing with a description of how to insert one piece into another was especially charming.
It came in two parts, and there was no other possible procedure.
Doing it the other way round required a considerable effort and involved breaking the plastic parts.
My contempt for instructions ended with my Seat Leon.
The 2003 production year still had a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including replacing the indicator light.
It was simple.
After a total of three steps, the job should have been done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual failed to state that, while the light bulb was was replaced in just three steps:
1. Remove the cover.
2. Unscrew the broken bulb and screw in a new one.
3. Put the cover back.
the bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the battery cover.
At first I expected that inserting my upper right limb into the guts of the car would allow me to find a spring or a screw so I could detach the cover easily, and then I would follow points 1-3 suggested by the thrifty author of the service book.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
That cover had no place, no space for a slender Cinderella-esque hand, let alone that of an obese Silesian.
I lost half an hour of my life with no success to show for it whatsoever.
The situation was further intensified by my wife entering the garage, summoned by the shouts and words she heard coming out of my mouth, very unusually.
"What are you doing in here?" she asked ingenuously.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I omit the vulgar terms only two publishable words remain.
I change the bulb.
"Why is it taking you so long?" she asked, taking a chance with a sentence that might have been the last of a long-running volume.
I explained the problem to her slowly, emphasising how I would torture the author of the manual, where the hot iron would burn the hand that wrote it, so that it could finally never write anything else. It was a mere introduction to the wide range of instructions from the film Witchhammer, including a specially commissioned bonfire on the knoll above Losinský castle.
"What about removing the box?" my wife hypothesised over the extrication of the battery.
In utter despair, I tried it and then steps 1-3 were as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought that nothing could surprise me.
That was until the day I received a phone call from a colleague who was on the verge of collapse after being monitored by two officers from the State Drug Control Service.
I know him as a composed colleague who has experienced both the possible and impossible in the field and who is able to recount wild stories in an unpeturbed voice.
"Imagine being fined for not having a guide to washing your hands," he said in a feeble voice.
I gradually pieced together the whole issue, which lay in the fact that he had no pictorial instructions on how to wash hands over the washbasin on the toilet used by patient.
The argument he submitted to the committee official was that adults usually wash their hands and that there is no need for pictograms to explain a habitual procedure carried out by decent people. It did not have the desired effect on her, however, and cost him a lot of money.
"That is not the case," she told him.
He was given to understand that the simple rinsing of lathery palms with flowing water is a primitive act at the Cro-magnon level, and that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, must perform this ceremony in ten steps.
As such, it is necessary to inform people that they must release the water from out of the tap.
The entire process has a total of eleven stages, but at the end you are rewarded by the joyous knowledge that you have washed your hands exactly as instructed by the State Institute for Drug Control.
I have to say that by the end I was inspired and prepared a detailed plan for activities on the toilet.
In terms of defecation, the procedure is unified and doesn't cause any problems. However, due to certain differences between the sexes, with urination it is necessary to give two sets of instructions.
The problem remains the pictograms, because creating the perfect procedure requires an exact sketch of all the anatomical details, which could provoke a certain outrage among prudish toilet users, despite the fact that they can finally learn that they have been wiping their opening the wrong way their whole life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár wounded and bleeding!
The singer is relatively new here, but you may have heard about him in June of this year, when he a huge event on Czech soil, hosted by such prominent personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and a number of others, moderated by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show himself to the public and to introduce his music video for the song Sara, which was launched by the aforementioned celebrities.
Few people know, however, that the shooting of the music video in Russia did not go without a hitch, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it did not go flawlessly.
The song Sara is very emotional and is about an unhappy affair between two lovers.
To make the scenes dramatic, in the video the singer's adversary had to punch him
At one point, however, he struck him directly on the nose so hard that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow I did not expect. I started bleeding immediately," Ladislav commented on the situation.
His colleagues and producers said that the situation was unfortunate and Ladislav failed to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was serious enough to stop the shoot from continuing.
The young artist's music video is here, and you can watch the scene where he gets punched.
The unsuccessful version where he was bleeding was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was recently found in the depths of the Volga.
The two young Russians, Ilja Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov, had been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search for them was carried out, but to no avail.
The police eventually ended the search because of the lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple lived not knowing whether they would ever find out what happened to them.
Twelve years later, the story has come to an unhappy end.
A diver found the wreck of their car lying on the bottom of the River Volga in the town of Cheboksary in Chuvashia.
The police only managed to identify the couple through the documents left in the car.
The documents survived an entire decade underwater, and without them the police would have taken much longer to determine the identities of the couple found.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed his father's car to pick his girlfriend up from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
Their finding was reported to the police in Cheboksary, which dragged the car onto the shore the next day.
Investigators believe that the young couple's death was an accident caused by the icy road that runs around the river.
However, the investigation is continued, and further details will be published once it has been closed.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
Trump threatens the President of Mexico over the phone.
In a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto this January, American President Donald Trump threatened that he wouldn't meet him if he publicly stated that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
During the conversation, Trump said that he would arrange the financing somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump also spoke openly to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This has emerged from transcripts of the talks published by the US daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border with Mexico a major promise in his campaign last year.
In Trump's first interview with the Mexican President shortly after he took office, he undiplomatically rebuked Peña Nieta for criticising his wall-building plan.
He described the country's southern neighbour as a growing political problem, and urged the Mexican president not to publicly state that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You cannot say that to the press," Trump repeatedly urged in a discussion on 27 January, and threatened to break off contacts with the Mexican President if he continued to issue defiant statements.
He will figure out the funding somehow and it will work out eventually.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall then I don't want to meet you anymore, because it is unacceptable to me," said Trump, according to the American daily.
He then claimed that the wall was as the least significant thing they would talk about, but politically it is probably the most important.
Trump issued the executive order to build the wall shortly after coming to power.
Mexico is rejecting the construction and financing of a 3200-kilometre-long wall, and the relations between the two countries have become critical.
At the end of March, Trump said that the United States would pay for the project.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The head of the White House said that the conversation was ridiculous.
This was the outcome of an exchange of views on the agreement that will see Australia grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internment facilities in the Pacific Island states.
At first Trump considered the deal to be absurd, but later conceded to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you created, but you will have to stick to it," Trump told Turnbull.
In some parts, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump approved of Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," joked Trump.
The tone of the conversation suddenly got sharper.
"I hate accepting these people," said Trump.
They're bad, I can assure you.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They're not going to be great people who go to work for the local dairy," he said.
During the conversation, he also said that a fugitive could become the Boston terrorist in five years.
Trump had telephone conversations with a large number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House. He often spoke to several leaders in a single day.
The call with Turnbull finally proved to be the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished, he stressed that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Rana's killer was executed before a crowd.
Her father also watched.
The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighbourhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl and took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he tossed near a mosque.
The young girl's violent death affected the entire country, which is currently facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was in the first row of a thousand-person crowd, which gathered together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was condemned under Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.
I feel a new person.
It felt like a weight was lifted.
It is a new day in my life.
Other members of the family were also present, shouting the slogan "long live justice" along with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square in a police van, which he was then dragged out of.
The police officers tied him around his waist.
One of the members turned his weapon against him, firing a shot from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd present celebrated each round that was fired.
Mr. al Almatari told the MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia Law have won," he added.
I stood on Liberation Square in Sanaa and waited for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then the whole family went to the morgue.
We took Rana's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
Both my wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would succumb to hateful madness, grab the killer and lynch him.
The execution was ordered by a court under the law of the Shiite Houthis.
Maghrabi was originally sentenced to 100 lashes when he was arrested, but his actions provoked such outrage that the judge decided to apply the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on 27 June.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the cellar of his house, they found evidence that the man had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could his motivation have been?
Even a beast would have been more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the wounds sustained by Rana's body were awful," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, and we informed the police the same day. We told the newspapers and all the TV stations, and there posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
It is generally believed the police got a tip off from the murderer's parents, who suspected their son of the atrocity.
Jamileh, the girl's mother, had to be hospitalised after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana had gone out to play with the other children in the neighbourhood.
I went to see where she was 10-15 minutes later.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block. Our friends took their cars and drove around, but our search was in vain.
The residents of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began gathering in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read out a report of the investigation into the crowd to appease them.
The accused apparently showed no regret for his actions.
Police officers read out the sentence just before the deed was carried out, but the convict only glanced at his executioner briefly.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many recordings were also shared on the Internet.
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.
The CzechTrade national commission is won by František Savov's company, who is prosecuted by the state.
The public commission by the CzechTrade state export agency was given to František Savov's publishing house Mladá fronta.
The officials gave him full points for all the qualitative criteria.
They did not mind the fact that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechTrade, announced a public tender for the four-year provision of editorial content for BusinessInfo in April.
The commission was awarded to entrepreneur František Savov of the Mladá fronta publishing house and has a total value of 30.8 million crowns.
However the Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and has been pursuing him in absentia.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic has called for his extradition.
The case was noted on the server Aktualne.cz.
According to CzechTrade's basic criteria, 60% of the decision to award the contract was based on the price offered and the 40% on the appeal and quality of the proposal.
Savov's company was substantially helped by the second criterion.
According to information from Dotyk.cz, it received 100 points in all the parts referring to the qualitative criteria.
It was this result that put it ahead of the second-best candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing house, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated on the basis of 404,900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received below-average scores from the judges for all qualitative criteria, with a total of 62 points.
Other organisations that took part in the tender include the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which is part of the Economia publishing house, like the Aktuálně.cz server.
The VLM publishing company has issued several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
After their rejection, they decided to contest the outcome with the ÚOHS Úřadu pro ochranu hospodářské soutěže (Office for the Protection of Competitions).
It believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The claimant is convinced that the contracting authority made the decision on the selection of a public procurement contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta at the expense of the claimant and other suppliers," reads the motion for the opening of proceedings submitted to the ÚOHS this week, which was published by the server Aktuálně.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of VLM, the selection committee's scores appear unjustified, and the 100% evaluation of Mladá fronta by all its members extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such miraculous success on the part of one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," said Klima.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade agency will not comment on the public commissions until they are closed, on principle.
All the information about the above contract is lawfully published in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the public tender notice.
"A full written report will be published after the completion of the contract, but during the term of the contract we can not express our opinion about it," said Štěpán Dlouhý, media agent for Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded with a statement that it considers it extremely problematic for Economia publishing house to release an article on Aktuálně.cz relating to a competition concerning its own business interests.
However, that fact was mentioned in the article.
They may have been helped in the tender by the fact that they provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal for the previous four years.
The competition was first launched in 2013 when the Department of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba of the ODS party.
The police accuses František Savov of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions for his companies, which caused the Czech state damages of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been requesting Great Britain for his extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the person behind his criminalisation is head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose sphere of influence includes the Mafra publishing house.
Last year a London court dismissed Savov's claim against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved since last year, and we have not received any notification from the UK yet," Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokesman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of Mladá Fronta, Savov was part of the Harvestor Limited firm, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund and buys up failing businesses.
It should also control Heavier Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past Savov was also associated with the seizing of property from the former Socialist Youth Organisation.
A biker riding around the pavements and park and ends up flipping over.
The biker aroused attention with a reckless ride along the streets, pavements and parks in Úsovice.
When the patrol began to follow him, he decided to drive in the direction of Stanoviště.
"Police officers were combing the city very carefully when he lost control while driving on one of paths to Mariánské Lázně. He entered a field with the motorcycle, and then crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, and carried the injured biker to a hospital in Pilsen.
Eventually the police discovered that the biker did not have a driving license, and that the licence plate on the motorcycle had been stolen, its serial number rubbed off and the manufacturing label removed.
As such, it is possible that the vehicle was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test did not reveal any alcohol in the driver's system, but a positive result was found for methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
Sparta midfielder Rosický: Changes are painful, but we have to keep believing.
Sixteen thousand fans were up on their feet applauding.
Tomáš Rosický goes to ground.
This was the same scene as the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
The Sparta midfielder livened up the game against Red Star Belgrade and set up several goals, but his teammates couldn't convert them in the end.
Pumped up by new multi-million reinforcements, the team from Letná ended up in the second round of the Europa League.
Was it hard to make something out of the match after the goal by Belgrade?
After the goal was scored, we needed to score four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to avoid losing at least, so as to build up our self-confidence to get something out of it for the next match.
We had several chances.
We have to work together as a team and bring our game forward.
Why did it take Sparta so long to come into the match?
The match was terribly overworked.
Out opposing teams combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, and we'd only had one shot by half time.
Of course, that's very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, and in the final third we managed to play at their level.
But you have to push your opponents into these positions more often.
Was the high number of changes to the configuration a problem?
Of course, this is one of the pains you have to deal with when a new team is formed.
We had only played three matches together and the configuration is still changing.
The coach needs to find the ideal 11 that fit together.
Is it encouraging for you to have played for part of two matches in a row?
They're still just parts of the match.
I myself don't know how my position will develop and when I will be able to play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place within Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it doesn't work.
It's the same as with injuries.
If you don't have faith, then you can't go back.
Sparta made a decision and we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but when they left they were embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
It was another great away trip, just like with the Bohemians.
I'm really sorry that we couldn't make them happy with a better performance.
I would like to give them a reason to come to the next one.
We can thank them for coming.
They won't remember these trips when it's been 15 years since I played here.
Can a cupless season be at least an advantage for the league?
At the moment we're fighting against ourselves. We will keep playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
An entrepreneur is facing ten years in jail for extreme tax avoidance.
The Constitutional Court dismissed a complaint from businessman Jiří Toman, who is to due spend ten years behind bars for tax avoidance.
The calculated damage amounts to 645 million Czech crowns.
In his complaint, Toman claimed that that the justice violated his fundamental rights, stating that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are not entirely complete.
However, the Constitutional Judges found the complaint to be unjustified, as CTK learned from the court database.
The Constitutional Court is not a court of appeal.
"It cannot assess the factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by the ordinary courts for a fourth time if it does not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict took effect in November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
Toman was in custody in Argentina, where he was found at the time of the decision by the Constitutional Court.
The penalty imposed is in the higher end of the statutory limitations, which corresponds to the damage incurred according to the verdict.
The High Court described the case as extreme tax evasion that had a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for the company World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damages of 645 million Czech crowns only refer to the period from January to July 2008, and according to an expert the total evasion exceeded one billion.
For procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to try Toman for the full amount.
According to the charges, World Servis did not include complete invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties to the order of at least tens of millions of Czech crowns, the company only paid taxes amounting to just a few hundred thousand.
World Servis and some of the companies it has done business with are related to entrepreneur Radomir Vybíral, who has been charged with 13 years in jail for VAT fraud over driving matters.
The Constitutional Court also dismissed his complaint.
Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
Russian athletes have not had their ban on starting lifted by the IAAF.
During its congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation upheld the international ban preventing the Russian athletes from starting because of the state-sponsored doping programme.
The result vote regarding the world championships, which begin on Friday, was unambiguous, as expected.
The prolongation of the ban was approved by 166 delegates, with only 21 votes opposing it.
The main reason for the rejection is that Russia has failed to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as noted by Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group.
His group recommended that the ban be upheld.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, as a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches with a compromised reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA is not yet fully operational, and does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA may undergo testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, meaning Russian athletes were not able to attend last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming international championships, 19 Russians who have previously proved they have been tested outside of the Russian anti-doping system for a long time will participate.
However, they will not be able to start championships wearing the national colours, and in the event of a victory, the Russian anthem will not be played.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.
The United States are breaking apart.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is widening.
California has declared a ban on its citizens traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee has hit back and has issued a retaliatory ban on its citizens traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, and US citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.
Rather, California has forbidden spending state money for its citizens to travel to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly pro LGBT, and any disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle is seen as discrimination.
By contrast, Tennessee has issued an exception to the law stating that if a psychotherapist has a moral issue with treating patients from the LGBT community, they are not required to provide the therapy themselves and can find the patients another therapist who does not have a problem with it.
Texas and other states have in turn adopted laws under which religious charities that are given children for adoption by their mothers are not required to give these children to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has placed a ban on funding its citizens' journeys to eight states from its own means.
In practice, this means that Californian professors are not allowed to travel to scientific symposiums in Texas with funding from their universities, for example, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions in Tennessee, for example, with the financial support of their schools.
To fund the trips, they must either get federal grants, although it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travels of citizens from State A to State B, or else private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has suffered and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it doesn't like the Californian policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, yet it will not place an embargo on travelling to California because of it.
It is placing the embargo as retaliation for the California embargo on Tennessee.
It will do the same to any state of the Union that orders a similar travel ban to another state, whatever the reason.
At the same time, it called on the parliaments of all the states to stop this madness.
The above is all fact, and now for a commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional. No part of it is unconstitutional.
States have the right to enforce conscientious objection laws, as well as to decide what their money can be spent on and what it cannot.
Secondly, what's wrong with conscientious objection?
When a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why couldn't they just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why should they be forced to sell pork under penalty of punishment if there are already enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, one baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or cakes that contain alcohol.
Why punish him and not just leave him alone and let the cakes be ordered from the hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all federal citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies with non-federal powers, that is, according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there are variety, multiplicity and diversity.
California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas and seven other states to also be California!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once legitimately fought for their lifestyle to be tolerated.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rule of live and let live, which all reasonable people ought to follow, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know of any situation in US history when states have done this for political reasons except this case.
States did not even impose sanctions on one another in times of struggle for civil rights for black people, where the North and West were on the side of integration, and the South on the side of segregation.
The only case was the in 1950s, and the political cause was slavery, and the war by the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like that is happening now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue Democratic states and the red Republican states is widening, and the US is disconnecting internally on a mental level.
Illegal agitation.
A critic of Putin received a hefty fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny received a fine of 300 thousand roubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential elections.
A court imposed a fine on him for calling on people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two large anti-government street protests over the past two months, and announced that he is setting his sights on the head of state position in March next year.
Current head of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said that the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling people to demonstrations through videos on the YouTube internet portal.
The fine is 300 thousand.
"Later, we'll take it off the judge's salary," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not take part in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered to be a fighter against corruption, believes the judgment to be politically motivated.
In addition to the 300,000 roubles, on Thursday the court also imposed fines 25,000 roubles on two members of Navalny's pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figured on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend themselves against Naval any way they can.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing from the Kirovles forestry company.
The verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeals in May.
The ruling is so final that it prevents Navalny from nominating himself under Russian law.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Heatwave in the Czech Republic.
Teachers hose down children.
Public transport drivers carry water and wear summer clothes.
The 35 children who attend the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4 are only able to go outside in the morning.
The school has just been renovated and the recently planted trees do not provide much shade yet.
There is no pool there, but the teachers cool children down with a sprinkler.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classroom, where the blinds and curtains are drawn.
They also try to cool down the air with a purifier as they do not have air conditioning.
It is challenging for both the teachers and the cooks.
"The indoor and outdoor temperatures exceed the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not really have been operating at that time," said Miloslava Makovičková, the school director.
There is a glass corridor in the nursery where the temperature reaches around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning around 6:00. We close the windows and we have blinds on the southern sides that protect us.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
There are better conditions at the Na Hrázi forest kindergarten in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have fully grown trees on the land, so we can stay underneath them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree with a table under it, and we do different things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the director of the kindergarten.
Teachers try to go into the woods with the kids, where there is a more shade.
The children wear damp caps and there are various kinds of water sports on the schedule.
"We have a hand-operated sprinkler that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering the children," said Kompanová.
Jitka Vilimovská, the headmaster of the nursery school in Novoborská ulice in the Prosek area of Prague, said that teachers are trying to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly developed garden, so they can stay under the trees," she said.
The go outside in the morning and then after 15:00.
Every child must have something covering their head.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose between slightly sweetened tea or diluted juice, and they drink water in the garden.
They also eat green salad every day, and their snacks always include fresh fruits and vegetables, which sometimes brought by their parents.
"For example, one mum brought about a ten-kilo melon for the kids today," Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or a summer uniform.
The DPP transport company in Prague is providing them with water, ionised drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The tram and bus drivers' cabins are air conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, the passenger compartments of some trams are also air conditioned.
The tram tracks have not been seriously damaged by the high-temperatures.
Small damage occurred in a circuit in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we must pay particular attention to make sure that a sufficient number of drinks are available to the drivers.
"Chilled drinking water is available on all routes, exchange points and depots," said Řehková.
At some depots and exchange points, workers also have access to so-called "sodobars", which dispense cold soda.
Drivers also receive soluble ionic beverages as a preventive measure.
"They can also wear a summer uniform, which makes drivers more comfortable during their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.
The hot, dry weather of the past few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic extinguished 108, which is twice the daily average.
During the day on Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in putting out fires.
"There are an especially high number of fires in the natural environment, which are associated with wildlife," said firefighter spokesperson Nicole Zaoralová.
The firefighters were not even brought any relief evening by the changes in the weather in the evening, as in many places the heat was replaced by storms and torrential rain.
Firefighters attended to 236 incidents in connection with thunderstorms.
In particular, many of the calls required them to remove fallen trees and branches.
"Central Bohemian region was most affected," Zaoralová continued.
However, the help of firefighters was also required in Stvolinek, Česká Lípa, where 60 people from the children's camp had to be evacuated to safety because of the storm.
The tropical temperatures also created work for rescuers in Prague.
On Tuesday and on Wednesday night, ambulances were called out to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from boilers.
As such, people should have their water heaters checked, rescue services warned.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released through incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headaches and fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, you should leave the affected room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
The husband of an MEP was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was picked up by a special government plane.
The government special plane brought the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
There were two ambulances waiting at the airport, and he constantly monitored by Slovak doctors while on board the plane.
The long planned flight went without complications.
According to TV JOJ, Robert Zitnansky had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of summer.
He is said to have been hit by a car, and has been in serious condition since then.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialised department in one of Bratislava's hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from the NOVA party.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Brazen Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite seeping out of her overalls!
During hot summer days, it's tempting just to wear the bare essentials that cover the most intimate places.
Dominika Mesarošová did the opposite, however.
At an afternoon encounter at Prague Zoo, swarming with actors, moderators, singers and everyone involved with TV Prima, she covered her body in a mini overall.
All it took was a few normal moves for the model to show everyone her silicon and even her behind.
Her overalls cut into her thighs several times, plus she was so tall that she had to keep adjusting them.
She was certainly not lacking the attention of the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
Plane makes an emergency landing on the beach.
A man and a little girl die.
The accident occurred at Praia de São João Beach in the Costa da Caparica region, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One witness told the SIC Noticias TV channel that the plane landed just above people who were sunbathing on the beach.
Some of the people on the beach reportedly ran into the sea to flee the danger.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the plane.
A 50-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl died on the beach according, to local media.
"The plane crashed and they were dead on site," stated police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationalities are not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom left it alive and were taken by police for interrogation.
D11, or how not to build a motorway.
Can the motorways in the Czech Republic ever be finished?
Here's a puzzle for you.
It is unfinished, even though construction started in 1978.
Even though it hasn't materialised, it is constantly being repaired.
It can't be built, even though it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, that's right, motorway D11 to Hradec Králové.
Construction on another section of it has recently halted by the Děti Země (Children of the Earth) movement for at least several months.
We Eastern Bohemians are getting our motorway in pieces, like cutting slices off a salami.
One round is sliced and then we have to wait and see if and when we'll get another.
We're not asking for miracles, though.
We just want to shorten driving times and to divert trucks going to or from Poland away from villages and towns.
The endless streams of trucks go straight through the towns like Jaroměř or Náchod, which cannot be reasonably avoided.
The final stretch of our dream motorway was begun in 2008, that is, an unbelievable nine years ago.
Since then, there hasn't been a modicum of progress.
Therefore, when construction began on the remaining four kilometres of the incomplete section to Hradec Králové and an archaeological survey was carried out other sections by Jaroměř, with works due to begin at the end of this year, you could hear corks being popped loudly in Eastern Bohemia.
At this point, nobody believed it however.
Last week it was announced that construction will not take place this year.
And maybe not next year either.
Děti Země, an organisation from Brno fighting for sustainable transport, has put a halt on the works.
Děti Země is repeating its tactics from D1.
They opposed the decision to grant the building permit in its entirety.
They are demanding a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all authorities involved.
For example, these include the City of Hradec Králové, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence and the Railway Authority.
Meanwhile, not far from D11 we come across the village with the expressive name of Pohřebačka.
We drive down, we simply continue along the motorway and all of a sudden we find ourselves on the side road next to it so we can join the line of traffic.
The worst part is that you can see similar stories across the country.
There's the terrifying, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorways.
Everyone has their own Pohřebačka.
What did Děti Země request?
What is the at the heart of the problems with road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is motorway network practically impossible to finish within the current system?

Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Fire breaks out in Kolín.
Dozens of firefighters arrived on the scene, assisted by a helicopter.
At 14:00 a fire broke out not far from Český Brod in the Kolín region, between Bylany and Liblice, burning approximately 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, and the firefighters declared a level three alarm out of a possible four.
According to the firefighter's spokesman Ladislav Holomcík, a helicopter helped to put out the fire from the air.
At 18:00 the firemen managed to extinguish the fire, which caused damages amounting to 700,000 Czech crowns.
Dozens of both professional and volunteer firemen fought the blaze on the spot.
The blaze was caused by a technical defect in the engine compartment of a combine harvester.
A helicopter helped to extinguish it by delivering six loads of water.
"The handed over the site of the incident to the owners, and it will be watched over by a volunteer fire brigade until 8:00 tomorrow," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Police charge three people, one of whom is a minor.
The police have charged three men with the setting up fire to a precious wooden church in Třinec-Guty, Frýdek-Místek on Wednesday.
One of the accused is a juvenile, and all three are Czech nationals.
Punishment for the crime could be as much as 15 years imprisonment.
Moravian-Silesian police chief Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
In his view, it was a deliberate crime.
"It is a very fresh matter, and the police are currently working on the motive for the whole incident," said Kužel.
He stated the police would discuss the possibility of taking the accused into custody.
He could not disclose any further information.
"At present, I can't tell you any more about it because the Criminal Police and Investigation Service are working on things, as is the state prosecutor, who is supervising the proceedings," said Kužel.
The wooden church of the "Body of God" in Gute dates back to the 16th century
It was a valuable monument with many original decorations and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The tangible damages will amount to tens of millions of Czech crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Questions were raised about the restoration of the church shortly after the fire began.
The majority of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, and the Ministry of Culture and the municipality are ready to pay extra costs. A public collection is also being prepared, and they are counting on contributions from the landowner, which is the local parish.
The similar 16th century wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
At that time, it was caused by an electrical installation.
An exact copy was created in its place.
The state is counting on its citizens to defend the country.
It will support their training.
By offering financial support for the state-sponsored organisations, the aim of the law on citizens' preparedness for defence of the state is counting on voluntary shooting training, or teams of trainers.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been assigned the role by the government, promises to improve the physical fitness and capabilities of the Czechs, so that they could then be used in crisis situations.
This results from the proposal prepared by the ministry.
Were the law to be adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support its defence.
According to its authors, the basic aim of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to make Czech Republic's population better prepared to defend the state, outside of military duties and on the basis of voluntary activities.
For example, the state would support ham radio, shooting or dog training societies financially or materially, boosting the capabilities of their members.
In return, it would get information about people who are willing to come to the country's aid in times of crisis, and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors would also be available to assist the associations and other interested parties in the training or education.
It also includes the organisation of talks with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One of the possible options envisage a new office that would be created to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation would be voluntary, and that the state would only use their skills if a state of emergency was declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual elimination of the previously clear boundaries between the different types of threats," the proposal states, referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry clerks noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, and not just military skills.
"The basic aim of the proposal is to create a very broad foundation that will enable every citizen to respond properly in the event of situations that endanger the sovereignty, lives, health or property of individuals, to protect themselves or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to perform the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the proposal specifies.
Adopting the law would necessitate considerable financial demands.
The exact amount depend on the option chosen, according to the Ministry.
For example, the department envisages up to 100 million crowns being provided as financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state.
If an administrative and coordination centre were to be established, its operation could cost about 60 million crowns a year.
More money would be required to pay wages or create an IT system.
The proposal also suggests that the regional military headquarters should to expand, employing a total of 42 more soldiers.
Ministry officials previously stated that the law would also help resolve the certain Czech politicians' objections to the introduction of the European Union directive concerning the possession of arms.
If adopted, it would allow gun enthusiasts who are part of the system to retain weapons that the directive would otherwise forbid.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."
Thursday becomes the hottest day
On Thursday, temperatures of 38.3 degrees were recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín, making it the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
It surpassed Tuesday, which had previously been the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The announcement was made by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Elsewhere, however, many of the temperature records set on Tuesday did not fall on Thursday.
The heatwave mainly affected Moravia, while in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were beaten or matched in 35 of the 145 meteorological stations, which have been measuring the weather for over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations saw new records set on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice the temperature during the day was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice, near Břeclav, the day time temperature reached 37.4 degrees, surpassing the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice near Brno the current temperature of 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records was last broken in 2013, like in Strážnice.
The high temperatures mainly occurred in the south and east of Moravia.
After Straznice, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovice, near Znojmo, and Brod nad Dyje, near Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.
On the other hand, according to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the highest daytime temperatures in western and northwest Bohemia were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures started growing there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will fade erode and there could be heavy rain on Sunday.
However, temperatures in Moravia will mostly remain high on Friday, and also on Saturday in the southeast of Moravia.
A malady has spread here.
It isn't enough for billionaires to have the same voice as other mere legal adults in the country during elections.
They want to adjudicate directly, and because not all of them are as bold as Andrel Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Along with other colleagues behind Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, Penta owner Marek Dospiva sponsors Robejšek's Realisty.
The second life of the Občanské demokratické aliance (Civic Democratic Alliance) is funded by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also its chairman
Convicted corrupter and Czech gambling king Ivo Valenta bought up the Strana soukromníků (Freeholder Party).
The Agrofert political movement, as the project by Andrej Babiš unintentionally named by the Mayor of Kroměříž Jaroslav Němec, deserves a whole chapter for itself.
The Starostové a nezávislí (Mayors and Independents - STAN) recently acquired their own billionaire.
The man in question is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the security equipment company Jablotron.
In his own words, he entered politics to do good.
Dědek's entrance in mayoral colours did not get off to a good start, however.
"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.
Which is to say that my goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostové movement to get 20 percent in the elections.
Various people smiled to themselves.
Dědek's slip of the tongue is rather symptomatic, however.
Millionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for election for the Starostové, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Dědek supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and cannot handle the lively rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
He certainly is not going into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babiš will remain a hero to me.
He is willing to step out of his world, which he has under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Starostové introduced him as a new reinforcement, he professed his admiration for Babiš once again.
He said he wanted the Starostové to learn to imagine a possible collaboration with Babiš.
Some people may appreciate the fact that Dědek sticks to his opinions and stands up for himself, no matter what team colours he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so awkward to the Starostové to create a second rate version.
Others still may ask whether the boss of Jablotron parted ways from the boss of Agrofert as part of a bad business deal, and is now looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
Dědek's first public appearances did not all revolve around Babiš, however.
Dědek promised to send the Starostové ten million crowns for the campaign.
And when they say they need more money, he will send more.
A few years ago, it would have been very hard for someone to take exception to such a statement.
Indeed, before the 2010 elections the legally recognised crook Zdeněk Bakala gave away millions to all the parties.
The political division of Vit Bárta's security agency, TOP 09, and the Civic Democrats came together for nearly thirty million.
We are now living in different times, however.
The law forbids anyone to give more than three million to a political party.
When Dědek entered politics, he could at least have studied the rules of the game.
Perhaps then he would not have had to ask why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
Dědek's first days in politics were topped off with a proposal to give tax benefits to families with children who are studying.
People with a university education earn about 50,000 crowns per month in our country.
Those with only basic education earn less than 20,000.
Someone earning 50,000 is rich under the local conditions.
Those earning 20,000 are poor.
In Dědek's view, the poor pay taxes fairly, and the rich should enjoy the benefits of the welfare state, in which they participate very little.
In short, rich people must be helped so that they do not have to face poverty.
The Starostové can congratulate themselves for their new acquisition and Babis is rubbing his hands.
Thanks to Dědek, the rest of us can confirm the fact that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains of who to vote for.
To my mind, it should be those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
It should be the people who don't employ their own party members or citizens of the state and who don't own parts of the country.
Finally, it should be the people who want everyone to live well in a rich country, and not just the few.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
He had to reduce the price of his villa complex by 234 million.
Selling real estate isn't always easy.
Often, it isn't even helped by having 11 bedrooms and a wonderful view of the sea, or by the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price had to be reduced by a staggering £8 million.
The Mirror.co.uk reported on the sale.
The brochure describing the lots states: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
You missed out on a place like no other.
But not even a connection between the the real estate company and the US president could support an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to slash the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, but the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the price of the villa complex is equivalent to about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And no wonder.
It consists of amazing 5-acre estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, with 12 fully equipped bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, numerous dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It includes several buildings.
Part of the property has a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palms planted on the plot.
There is a wonderful view of the sea from the terrace.
According to real estate experts, the price reflected the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the estate is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculations, he is thought to have paid about £15 million.
He bought it as a rental property.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin,
but now with the new price, it is in second place.
Another property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
An NBA star on the green.
Curry is fighting to make the cut in California.
Despite messing up his first shot, star basketball player Stephen Curry made it through the first round between professional golfers.
The two-time holder of the record for the most-valuable NBA player took part in the Egoie Mae Classic, a lower series run by Web.com Tour in Hayward, California. He ended his first round with 74 shots and will keep fighting to make the cut.
Golden State point guard, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously, and his first shot ended up in the drink holder of a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate as on the basketball court, but he had a dozen professionals behind him on the scoreboard with four-over-par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to get started, to have to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it settled down a bit," said Curry about his enormous stage fright.
I very nervous when I took the first shot of the tournament, but it was everything I hoped for.
"If you'd told me I was going to shoot 74 going into the round, I'd take that all day, every day," he added.
If Curry is able to make the cut, which is likely to be around two under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to prove themselves on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the nerves, it might work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who had played in celebrity tournaments in the past, as well as mixed amateur and professional competitions.
The event in Hayward is his first time starting in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He was granted a sponsor's exception to take part in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a young panda that mated in the wild has given birth in captivity.
The panda rescue programme is a huge success.
The centre is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas in captivity.
Centre worker Chang Chi-Chung told New China that panda breeding is at risk of inbreeding.
There were only 471 pandas living in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
The effort to mate captured pandas with wild ones is the first step to help protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cao Cao was released into a nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on 11 March.
Researchers could see every step she took thanks to the tracking device on her neck.
Cao Cao met her chosen mate 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the local male lasted for a minute and a half, and was successful.
This can also be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not generally considered to be the most successful lovers in the animal kingdom.
Males are bad at estimating the time when the female is ready, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, given that Cao-Cao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after delivery.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced, quoted by bTV.
A group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, was detained by the police in Sithonia in the morning of August 1.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The ministry of foreign affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
Spilková is in fiftieth place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková is ranked in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
She passed through the course in Kingsbarns, Scotland with a score of one below par, hitting three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player is hoping that she will make the cut for the first time at a famous majors contest.
The competition with a $3.25 million prize started off best for American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round with a record of 64 putts, and a score of eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are taking millions of toxic eggs off the market.
The Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms because of the incident.
According to Reuters, NVWA, the Netherlands's Food Safety Authority, has examined 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, which they claim means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are acceptable.
The authority stressed that the risk only affected a limited number of egg types, meaning that a specific number can be given.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and does not pose a threat to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Spokesman for the Czech State Veterinary Administration Petr Majer said that recently no eggs and chickens have been brought into the Czech Republic from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities gone so far as to shut down farms.
However, veterinarians are taking samples of eggs and chicken meat from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, countries in which products with problematic insecticides have been found on the market.
Eggs from Belgium were last seen in the Czech Republic in April, and eggs from the Netherlands were last imported in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands present in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is is used in treatments against fleas, lice and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
In high doses, it causes feelings of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is amazing, I'm going to miss, said goalkeeper Sedláček as he looks for a new engagement.
I would like to play for another 10 years.
"Maybe I'll go back one day," smiled the 27-year-old Sedlacek, who could start the season in a jersey for Zlin.
It depends on whether he finds an engagement before the start of the new year.
How were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like in school, then three.
I didn't play much the first year, I had an experienced goalie above me.
I was learning.
In the second year I started playing.
Before the third season I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, and we alternated in the role.
Last year, I assumed I would play all the time.
But we only got five points in the first ten games, so the coaches began to change things around.
My teammate ended up playing more often.
That's just how it is.
They wanted to warm him up for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Amazing.
It's a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss it.
I found a girlfriend there.
We've been together three years, and we'll get married next year.
So I brought something back with me.
How challenging is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The top ten teams are really high quality.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, which have to change their playing style against them.
The other side have the skills, so you have to compensate for it with something.
That means playing more towards the rear, fighting more.
I did not see any problems in the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the empty space.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to keep playing.
They shoot more in the Czech Republic.
Did you have any problems travelling and shifting between seven time zones?
If you don't have a family it's not a problem.
You can sleep in peace.
The schedule is normally arranged so that you play around four away matches and then you get two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?
Like a national team.
All of Latvia follows ice hockey, it's the national sport along with basketball.
Everyone supports them.
Even when things were going badly, a lot of people would come.
Did Dinamo's activities in the KHL help Latvia to move to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been going since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
Their results at the World Championships started to improve from that time.
They only just lost 1:2 in the quarterfinals against Canada at the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
It was an unbelievable result for them.
They've reached a higher level thanks to the KHL.
More and more Latvian players are setting their sights on the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts made it to Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is about to sign a contract.
Why is it that so many of them go there?
They're not second rate players, they're high quality.
Our local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians included.
It's a natural progression.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why is it that you still don't have a position?
I knew that I wouldn't stay in Riga since the beginning of February.
So, I started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But since they didn't have a budget for a goalkeeper we didn't come to an agreement.
It was classic.
We spoke to various teams that ultimately went on to sign someone else.
So now I'm training back home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
I was four years ago, when I went away and didn't know how it would be.
The current situation isn't exactly ideal, but on the other hand it means I can spend some time at home.
I did some playing in the KHL, so I see it differently now.
The question is when and where I'll sign.
How likely is it that you'll start the new year in Zlín?
Anything could happen.
We'll see how things stand in a month.
Now all I can do is wait to see what my agent arranges.
Do you have a preference for a particular competition?
Given how last season went, I'm not really in a position to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone to ring.
The government trip to Lety continues.
In January of this year I wrote about the camp at Lety, near Orlík in the article "With the Care of a Decent Manager?"
The essence of the problem remains the same, and so I'll refer to the key passage of the article.
There has been talk about the camp in Lety for many years.
For the readers who do not know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at the official cultural heritage site of Pietní místo Lety, for example.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, it states that the camp lay two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that it served as a labour camp from 8 August 1940, as a displaced persons camp from 1 January 1942 and became a Roma camp on 2 August 1942.
The text below this goes on to describe life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when Lety's first prisoners were assigned to the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
The overall total was 420.
It is a very sad history of enormous suffering on the part of human beings caused to them by human beings and perverse ideology.
There is no question about the need to remember these events constantly.
There is also no question that the remembrance should take place at the memorial located in the place where these people suffered.
The problem lies elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was slightly forgotten about, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and on the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, and a memorial was erected at Lety in 1995.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but so far it has not happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been governed by the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
These are facts about the camp's post-war fate in brief.
At least, that was until autumn of this year, when the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to call an expert judgment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government is rumoured to buying the pig farm back after.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some figures, but I would probably upset the plans if I went to the public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion leads to.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may amount to hundreds of millions, while according to others the price may reach up to a billion.
In any case, it will definitely not be a cheap matter.
And just a few hundred metres from the former camp is a memorial in which the state invested almost 10 million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction were funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which obviously is not likely, in my opinion it would still be a waste of money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a solemn place of commemoration, stands there thanks to the will of history, almost in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants to can go there to pay tribute to the memory of those who suffered and were killed.
I don't see any reason to change it!
Let's just leave it as it is, and maintain the site of reverence with the utmost care.
The property, and now also the taxpayers' money, should be entrusted to a responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, to oversee it with the care of a dutiful manager.
They should at least treat it as if it were their own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister do not represent the whole government.
However, given the aforementioned facts, I feel that the leader of the ANO movement is only using it as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May I went directly to the place to see it.
It has a good driveway, orderly parking and replicas of the wooden camp huts.
There is an exhibition in one, and an integrated toilet with running water in another.
There is a small, outdoor amphitheater with a seating area and a view of the memorial site, made from stones placed on a slight slope.
There are a lot of flowers and wreaths.
All the attributes correspond to the meaning of this place, and are suitable and appropriate.
Archaeological research is currently taking place on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible to preserve some of the uncovered foundations, for example, and at least make them accessible in an appropriate visual manner.
Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could be focussing his efforts in this direction.
If he succeeds in pushing the government to buy a pig farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic time in the role of Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
Chicken skin king Láďa Hruška is facing the challenge of his life.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multifaceted picture began to emerge thanks to the new show "Zdeňkova akademie" on TV Prima.
Hruška immediately grabbed his chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply to your cooking academy, because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video shared on social media.
And since the two of them have been quarrelling for several years, Láďa did not miss the opportunity to irritate afforded to him.
"In return, I can teach you the Znojmo way of cooking chicken meat, American cucumbers or invite you to go canoeing and show you why fried cheese is a favourite," provoked Hruška.
He's taking his participation in Pohlreich's new show very seriously.
It is time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"It's question of being a chef," he told Blesk.
Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show "Ano, šéfe!"
Prima has only reacted to Hruška's participation in the cooking academy by treating the whole thing as his personal activity outside of television.
Hruška dealt a severe blow to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first recipe.
Within a few days, he had sold over 300 thousand copies!
The new show, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcasting schedule, is a fully fledged cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience, and will introduce them to 12 different cooking techniques across 12 episodes.
In the last episode of his show "Teď vaří šéf" in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear ("hruška" in Czech) ironed onto his shirt.
If my face was there, I would laugh a lot.
"I just smile over the pear - pears are healthy and full of vitamins," said Láďa.
He has his own thoughts on Láďa's cooking.
"Cooking according to Láďa Hruška isn't even considered at home, because I don't let gastropunks in my home," the chef said clearly.
I highly appreciate Zdeněk Pohlreich, even if he things I make chicken with honey.
His recipe does not appear in my show, however," Hruška said, unforgivingly.
He's a moron!
If you ask me, he's no chef, he's a TV clown.
"He's gastronomically illiterate or an imbecile," Pohlreich said of Hruška at one of the presentations.
"I'm not going to throw my arms about like a 20 year-old, but I'm not going to try and resolve it any more," said Hruška, in response to the score of verbal insults.
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Young woman gets stuck in a swamp at Lake Mácha and the police wade in after her.
The girl set off to the beach at around 2 o'clock in the morning on Sunday.
Instead of swimming, she got trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to call the police with her mobile phone, she had just 12 percent of battery left.
"Because of that, the police soon lost contact with her," shared police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols went to the site she described, but finding the young woman was no easy task.
"Some of the police officers had to wade through reed marshes for hundreds of metres before they felt the ground under their feet again," stated Baláková.
And yet she was still missing.
The police officers orientated themselves according to the direction of her call for help.
"In order not to miss this connection at least, they agreed with her that they would count out loud," the spokesman said.
Police found the woman at 4:15 in the swamps of Borny.
She was at the end of both her physical and mental strength, and showed signs of hypothermia.
As a result, she was taken to the Českolipská hospital by ambulance.
Is there a link between Dědka and STAN?
From sought-after bride to sales girl.
There's a touch of irony involved.
With his web project hledameslusny.cz, it seems like the billionaire would essentially like to tell voters that STAN is suffering from a lack of suitable people.
And he also stated that the politically disparate group of lesser-known mayors and independents does not actually have a nationwide programme for the parliamentary elections.
After an interview with Dědek, its electoral candidate will be a proper person, whatever their political opinion.
Vít Bárta also started once, and it did not work out well.
In his pursuit of decent people and personalities that will potentially replace some of the mayors as candidates, as even Gazdík conceded, Dědek is also dismissing the favourite argument of the head of STAN that the movement's greatest value lies precisely in the political scrutiny and experienced of the mayors, who are traditionally the most popular politicians, an idea also confirmed by the polls.
They are now being casually replaced the newly acquired unknown figures.
Gazdík explained the total break with the KDU, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by claiming the movement does not want to waste its identity on KDU candidates.
However, if STAN's identity was only doubted by a few people, the simple identity game has ended with Dědek's arrival on the scene.
Gazdík has not only defined himself against Andrey Babiš's ANO party for a long time, in their first joint press conference Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated: "My goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostové movement, to gains 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope that the movement didn't take it the wrong way.
Dědek is a successful entrepreneur and billionaire, and certainly not by chance.
He often talks about politics just like Babiš, but unlike him he does not his his own political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been acting more like a reality show than a real political party, and Dědek's helping hand seems to be making a shop assistant out of a sought-after bride.
STAN went with TOP 09 for a while, then with the KDU and it is now looking for appropriate people to make a change.
Let's hope they click with someone.
Police dogs trained in helicopter flights in Most
Dogs specialised in hunting explosives and search dogs were trained in a helicopter flight over Most lake today.
Police dogs must not be cowardly or scared of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of police cynologists for the Ústí nad Labem region.
Police dog training takes around two years.
At Most, previously educated dogs were trained like adults, and those who are not yet trained just passed by.
In addition to the standard training, which involves being exposed to specimens of explosives around the lake and looking for a lost figurine, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
The dogs had to get to work to as soon as the helicopter landed so that they didn't have problems with it moving.
"The helicopter lands, then the dog goes and starts searching immediately," said Tomášek.
Dogs that that are upset or unable to start working as the helicopter flies are excluded from training.
"They are usually kept in the garden by the handlers, for example," Tomas added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specialties in the Ústí region.
German shepherds are the dominant breed, but there are also a growing number of Belgian shepherds.
The handlers take care of them from the time they are puppies.
"They raise them alone, preparing the dogs for the service they will perform for us," Tomášek added.
The animals undergo repeated veterinary tests to reveal any possible health issues or disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and not timid, they take the first test at 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get a precise aim," Tomášek added.
Their time in the police service depends on the dog's health.
Most of them remain for around 8 to 10 years.
They generally live with their handlers.
Narcos season 3 trailer: With Pablo Escobar gone, the Cali Cartel take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite season two of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the former receiving its first trailer, teasing the show's upcoming villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned their attention towards the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" just with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel's leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) being the brains, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) running the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) based in New York.
The newly released trailer sees Pedro Pascal return as Javier Peña, the character enlisting American and Colombian law enforcement to help with the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castro.
Season three of Narcos will debut 1 September.
Afghan democracy depends on political role for women, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections take place April 5.
The Taliban has issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition of international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first time power is handed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million total registered voters.
Unique brewery brews beer once again.
The newly revived brewery is back serving up good beer.
The passion and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobeč u Mšena back to life a few years ago.
The brewery was first commemorated in 1586 and has Renaissance foundations, and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a train depot.
This was followed by years of prosperity, when the brewery was especially famous for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II and the brewery was nationalised in 1984.
After that, the buildings served as state property.
The demolition work was finished by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and stripped for building materials.
However, in 2007 new hopes emerged in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouza.
They began to repair the buildings with utmost respect for the spirit of the property, down to the smallest detail.
They devoted themselves to carefully studying archive documents in an attempt to retain the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same look as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work has been rewarded by a declaration from Ministry of Culture proclaiming the brewery to be a cultural monument, and the building has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Trail.
In 2015, they festively revived the tradition of beer brewing.
If you want to sample a great beer from Lobeč in the scenic countryside around Kokořín, you can visit the pub in the brewery grounds.
When brewing the beer, they use water from the protected landscape area of Kokořín, malt from the fields in Lobeč and hops Žatec.
In the beer you, you can taste traditional light lager as well as dark beers and specialties.
Don't miss out on the tour of the brewery, which is held on Saturdays and Sundays at midday and 13:30.
The largest defensive fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind in the world?
This unique building was supposed to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the ridge of terrain above the village of Babí.
Originally, it should have been formed of up to 12 bunkers connected by a cavernous underground area.
This was where the headquarters, barracks, ammunition, supplies, power generator, engine room and hospital would have been.
However, the Munich Agreement put an end to it.
In less than a year, it was only possible to build a single massive reinforced concrete bunker and the underground spaces cut off.
Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg society, who started to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990, you can also see it for yourselves.
Seventy five percent of the underground area is already accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and the underground area, there is also an armed light fortification building, two deployed infantry cabins, trenches and a nature trail by "Opevněné Trutnovsko".
Refreshments, a homey alcove and breathtaking views of the region are guaranteed!
This unique and amazing Czech building has been on a list alongside such sights as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's harbour near Rome, or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov Monastery dates back to the beginning of the thirteenth century, and today it mainly consists of a stately four-wing convent building overlooking an exquisite garden.
Unfortunately, the list it belongs to is that of unique buildings that are in danger of collapse.
However, its devotees do not want to give up, and a lot of events are being held to support the monastery.
One of them is the annual dinner for the Chotěšov Monastery, which will take place on Saturday 5 August. Vladimír Mišík amd Ivan Hlas will perform, you can see fencing duels and look at the amazing huge buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
Above all, you can enjoy the atmosphere of this incredible place.
Do you want to look a Neanderthal in the face?
The exhibition Vítejte u neandertálců (Welcome to the Land of the Neanderthals) in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno is beckoning visitors to go an unusual excursion into the deepest prehistoric times right back to the Stone Age and the world of our ancestors.
You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope perfectly with all sorts of extreme climate conditions, especially with the alternation of ice and inter-glacial ages.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful as the predators of their time.
You will also learn about their appearance, their anatomy, their technological and hunting skills, as well as their aesthetic sense.
You wouldn't call them Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The fourteenth KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is held on Saturday the 5th in Veveří castle.

How does the Moravian-Silesian region taste?
The seventh anniversary of the famous gastro-festival "Jak šmakuje Moravskoslezsko" (How does the Moravian-Silesian Region taste) takes place on Saturday 5 August 2017, in the mountain spa area of Karlova Studánka.
The cooking will be provided by chef Miroslav Kalina, and you can sample culinary specialties and regional food and enjoy a musical and dance performance. There is also rich programme for children including creative workshops, theatre, a bouncy castle, a Smurf prize pathway and, of course, a number of competitions.
Identify plants with one click.
Students with a herbarium and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free Pl@ntNet app.
Whenever someone is interested in which plant they have just encountered, they can find out about it from the application.
All they have to do is take a photo of the plant and the application will recognise the species.
The new application is available for both iOS and Android, and was presented on Tuesday by a representative of the CEEV Centra etické a environmentální výchovy (Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education) in Horský Park in Bratislava, as part of the Tajný život města (Secret Life of the City) project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who took pictures of plants from their surroundings with their teachers to add to the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download from the Tajný život města website.
The main goal of French programmers was to encourage as many people as possible to contribute their images to the app, thereby increasing the number of plants it can recognise.
"Children can go out into the forest with a tablet or mobile phone in their hands," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of the project.
Starting from sufficiently high quality photos of a flower, leaf or fruit, the app can find its name in a few seconds, which will then appear under the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed the application to be translated into Slovak and Czech as part of the Tajný život města project.
As such, users are welcome to add plants that do not yet appear in the database once they have created an account.
"The French will determine whether it is useful and then add it to the database," said Poláčková.
GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does the political penalty have broadly understandable rules?
Donald Trump approved the anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And the day before that, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it can't go on.
His concept of sanctions is slightly wet behind the ears.
These things can't be lumped together.
Madura's Venezuela has indeed set out on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is just not behaving in the way the American president would like.
Russia is a whole chapter in itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum it all up so that even a common voter, whether American, European or other, would understand what the system of rules and the sanction policy are based on, it would be almost impossible.
With the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only following through on what President Obama put into place. He is simply the one to give them the official stamp.
So why such a fuss?
Last year, Europe was frightened that if that American elections went in favour of Trump, he would embrace Putin and remove the sanctions.
It was a terrible prospect.
In practice, the opposite turned out to be the case, however.
Trump has not relaxed the sanctions, but actually tightened them.
But Europe is even more scared.
German Minister Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Are the sanctions approved by the UN Security Council really kosher?
But then, the EU's anti-Russian sanctions aren't kosher either.
European Commission chief Juncker is once again complaining that Trump's sanctions are threatening the EU's energy security.
Does that mean that only sanctions that are too weak to threaten anyone should be used?
The common voter is left in the dark.
For three years they heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends solely on the fulfilment of the Minsk agreement concerning Ukraine.
It is understood that it is actually about the EU's energy security.
The voter is more in the dark than ever.
Russia is penalised for meddling where it shouldn't.
China is berated for not meddling enough.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his own country.
All these punishments and considerations have their own rationality.
But can anyone see a system, order or rule?
Andrej Babiš: I will not consider cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš got married, toured the Republic with his visionary book and finalised the electoral programme.
Except for the Pardubice Region, all the candidates have already been prepared.
To use his own words, he did not interfere with them in any way.
He even agreed to allow "hejtman" (marshall) and Shadow Education Minister Ivo Vondrák lead the Moravian-Silesian region.
"But if he is successful, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of parliament or hejtman," Babiš stated earlier, confirming his viewpoint.
You have upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with the idea that directly elected mayors and chief magistrates should manage municipalities and towns on their own, only using managers.
Do you really mean it?
That isn't how it was.
I am a supporter of direct democracy. We elect the president directly and I am convinced that it should be the same for mayors and chief magistrates.
I don't talk about abolishing the representatives in my book, they can stay there comfortably.
There question is how many of them there should be.
During the presentation of your book "O čem sním, když náhodou spím" (What I Dream About When I Happen to Sleep), I heard you speak about the abolition of representation with my own ears.
I don't remember that.
I spoke about direct elections and reducing the number of representatives.
There are nine million inhabitants in New York, which has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague has 1.2 million citizens and 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is making a fuss that little is being built and there are no great projects planned, but she is not competent in that regard.
The same applies to the government, which has only been governed by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I'm not saying they did that well.
The current prime minister isn't guiding anything, he only moderates the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it is difficult to enforce.
The only change we have in the plan is the one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the regulations governing the Chamber of Deputies, to prevent unnecessary attendance by members of parliament, who should mainly be working on committees and panels instead of Chamber meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That you will rule the government like a dictator, control the Chamber of Deputies with 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and control the whole country through the grateful mayors and magistrates.
That is certainly not the case.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of representatives.
The French President Macron announced that he was reducing the legislative board by a third, and there are 57,000 French people per one legislator, whereas here the ratio is 17,000 Czechs to one.
Nobody accused Macron of endangering democracy, however.
Even if somebody won the majority vote in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms in place to prevent them from making dramatic changes.
The temptation is great for those who have the parliamentary majority. Just look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing of the sort applies to the ANO movement.
We just need a team in government that will work for the people, not for their parties or departments.
I do not understand why we have not even been able to agree on increasing wages for teachers and workers in the cultural and social services.
Why did they vote for me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who already have 60 thousand?
Would you clamp down on that as prime minister?
The prime minister has to intervene when the ministers behave wastefully, confusing the government with a travel agency and using the state coffers as a business venture, like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government. Conflicts should be thrown out of it.
The material that comes into the cabinet must be ready. There is no room for coalition ruptures, power ballots and deals. Decisions must be made there.
How do you expect to have a cohesive team when the ministers mainly act on behalf of the party?
The constitutional law is above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply and turfed Babiš out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if they have character and leadership skills then these kinds of gestures are not needed.
They measure everyone equally and demand perfect execution from one and all.
Do you already know who you would appoint as the Minister of Finance?
I'm not thinking about it at all. We will probably will not end up in government. Nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I do not know what I've done that's so terrible.
So much skepticism is out of place.
The mayors (STAN) enlisted businessman Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you. The KDU-ČSL may beat your winger Jiří Čunek.
I don't think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomir Zaoralek, who is not ruling out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus might win out in the ODS, and he also isn't against it.
I would leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and ANO Deputy Chairman Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomio Okamura's SPD, such as in terms of the economy, for example.
So, Okamura supporters are being considered as coalition partners?
Mr. Brabec claims that he did not say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history. He stood as Vít Bárta's puppet for the VV, then he earned money for his firm from Úsvit. Some kind of coup took place.
He is, of course, a strong personality.
But he is browned, somehow.
Looking at his plan, it involves the widespread engagement of people in the management of society, i.e. direct democracy, which we can agree on.
That's not what I'm asking you about at all.
I'm interested in whether it is acceptable for you to work with someone who has xenophobic views, talks about the gallows at demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We will not consider cooperating with Mr Okamura's party, I can not imagine it.
He clearly went into politics for the sake of profit.
And what about having the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I cannot imagine it, but the voters will decide.
The winner will negotiate with the person who comes second, but God knows who will be the winner and who number two.
Of course, it is important for them to able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to run the state as a business.
The government simply needs to be led. Prime Minister Sobotka left everything to rot, he never made any decisions.
Coalition issues like CEB or EGAP did not work.
Anyway, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also why he threw me out.
As soon as he did, ČEZ controlled the Czech government.
It's unbelievable that the Prime Minister would send a decree written by ČEZ's management stipulating how the Minister of Finance should vote at the ČEZ General Meeting.
If you become prime minister, will you change the proportions of personnel in the supervisory board and will you change the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I become prime minister then we'll see.
I'm not there yet.
Rumour has it that ČEZ has already been sending you signals.
They would like to exchange the hood cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with ANO.
So maybe after the elections, everything will go ahead.
I don't know anything about that.
I have no Pokorný or Růžička style lobbyist. I am a separate entity and I do not deal with this at all.
So answer directly.
If you become the head of government, will you go after the leadership of ČEZ, České televize (Czech Television) or Všeobecné zdravotní pojišťovny, which are the institutions that you criticise?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
Meanwhile, he has been doing what he wants for years, thanks to kickbacks for traditional political parties.
Just look at Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Even though the state has a majority in ČEZ, it never directed it. It just served as a makeweight, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter, in my opinion.
ČEZ should take Dukovany, value it, stick it into a subsidiary, arrange financing, hold a tender for the supplies or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Česká televize?
Some of its shows have a permanent campaign against me, but I do not have and will not have any authority to get rid of it.
But you could control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television fees, but they do not really know how these institutions are run.
How is it possible that they don't know?
The Chamber of Deputies approves a report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the ČT and ČRo (Czech Radio) general managers.
Look at how the news handled the Sobotka-Kalousek super-pact, which always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigation files and Lex Babiš.
Sobotka was stupid enough to let himself be pushed around by Kalousek, who made him throw me out of government, which won percentage points for TOP 09 percent, but ČSSD took them away.
They are afraid of an interference to their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy posed by Babiš.
Nobody is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how, as the first deputy chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek is building a powerhouse by placing his son in the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state-owned companies like Pražský dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Company) and České dráhy (Czech Railways) through the lawyer Květoslav Hlína?
We have a long-term dispute over it.
I don't like it, and I've reproached him for it several times.
Faltýnek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at considerably lower rates and is reliable.
I would not take it so far.
I didn't have anyone as Minister of Finance.
Unlike the Social Democrats, we have never had any corruption scandals, no Pelts, no Kratochvílová, no Březinas.
As soon as there was any hint of clientelism in our party, we threw out threw the people involved out right away.
I'm not willing to compromise in that regard.
If anything like that were to happen, we would get rid of the relevant people, no matter who they were.
Welsh AMs worried about 'looking like muppets'
There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule.
One Labour AM said his group was concerned "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo.
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet.
In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's neither."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People socialize in a different way" nowadays, he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would seek to pass along the costs" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!
I got bit!'
His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.
Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans push into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons" Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far the top of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future that would see her through the next couple of decades.
Her decision to pull out left everyone involved absolutely stunned.
Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow HQ which are ready to be sold."
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays to its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother-of-three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples holiday together and Jones has a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We wouldn't comment on his business affairs."
Tough talk 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about criticism he would get from the news media for making a comment some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his mock "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North doesn't see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping up pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping free hostages and getting the remains of American servicemen returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Quake Devastate an Island, Killing Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for instance, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been dislocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they're not requesting international assistance, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earth shaking that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains woefully underprepared for nature's wrath.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning had been in effect, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has lavished money on roads and railways.
But funding shortfalls have plagued Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge dips deep equalizer vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while about 30 yards out from the Chelsea goal with his team trailing 1-0.
He tapped the ball to his left before scooping a shot toward the far post.
The attempt sailed high above the box as it drifted toward the right top corner of the net.
The ball eventually dropped over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and took one touch and didn't think about it too much and just took the shot on."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after getting a score in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker heeled a pass back to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before spinning off near midfield and sprinting into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at midfield.
He then fired a beautiful through ball, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard outran the defense and finished into the far post netting with a left footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool battles Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings brought down in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake which struck Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man being arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information which is vital to our investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found is local to Birkenhead and she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police have said they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back into his flat but is being told by police no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
Residents are now being told it will be hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
She keeps repeating 'it's so awful'.
At 2pm two police vans were inside the cordon with another van just outside.
A number of officers were stood inside the cordon monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 of 30th September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row
Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer Pig Mauls Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a sty at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a hoggery on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to a neighbouring pig sty open.
He said that in the sty was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound hog had mauled the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mangled," the cousin, referred to by his surname "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Though rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years previously, a 650 pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
"They're just being playful.
They're nippers, very inquisitive ... they aren't out to hurt you.
You just have to pay them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest US
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possibility landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Flash flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely ill advised to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to become raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring locally gusty winds and blowing dust.
The approaching trough will bring some locally heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of over half an inch are possible, which could cause minor debris flows and slick roadways.
This would be the region's first rainfall of their wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is nearly a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with widespread 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long term climate forecast is indicating high chances for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's gripping testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh groped her drunkenly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in impassioned testimony, said he's 100 percent certain that it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company was counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures weren't immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people who watch in offices.
To put that in perspective, that's an audience size similar to that for a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught be CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with eyes downcast for several minutes as he was berated, televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "you have power when so many women are powerless.""
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was evident Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the one with her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "entirely preposterous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into prison on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wayde.
His bond has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens in assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano that sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists.
Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting.
Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting "No forgetting, no forgiveness" faced off with unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we lived through one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house rammed by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers to consign Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side remain without an away win in the Premiership this season and face leaders Hearts, who they trail by eight points, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their directness causing Rangers all manner of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his effort across the face of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halkett's header across goal.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces.
And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box.
By that stage, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play.
Crosses continually came into the Livingston box and were continually cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waved away.
'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and personnel has scarcely changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, marshalling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers were short of inspiration, though.
As good as they have been at times under Gerrard, they fell well short of those standards.
Their final ball was lacking - only once did they cut the home side open - and it is something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-table.
Erdogan get mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies.
They've fallen out over issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road crash: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash happened near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended, but the man died at the scene.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his next-of-kin.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers hurt in disorder
Six prison officers have been injured in a disturbance at a high security men's jail, the Prison Office has said.
Disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involves eight inmates and is contained to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison's governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Flooding (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy tracks across the Desert Southwest, delivering flash flooding risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals up to 4 inches possible.
For those out of flash flood risk, Rosa's rain may be a blessing since the region is drought-stricken.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore powering down.
Thus, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across portions of Mexico could be heavy, posing a significant flooding risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then track up through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash flooding and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted murder arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers have appealed for anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President obliquely referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with toll seen rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday's massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.
The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally crippled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," it said.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Toll Soars Above 800.
It Is Very Bad.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala have made it safely to Palu city, where employees are sheltering in tarpaulin shelters set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed scenes of devastation on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw lots of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as aid groups began the grim motions of starting the gears of disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staffing from overseas can only start flowing if the site of a calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
"It's still a province level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can open for international assistance but there's no status yet."
As the second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were holding out hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that leaven the bleak story lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was plucked from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been pinned under rubble for two days with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which wrapped up earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, though, only resulted in one gray check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The car's driver had been emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was occupied, another man "ran up from behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money meant for delivery.
Witnesses spotted multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to the release, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."

Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the military to repress the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the plaza on Oct. 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities draws youth to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even as the U.S. overall lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it's aiming to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much farther behind U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard in order to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. bolster its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should automatically be offered to PhD's in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations dole out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen action in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the vote's outcome to make it decisive.
The name change would requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their ballot.
"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their ballot for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and pulling up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the huge majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first serious blow to policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dispatched of the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at midfield at the start of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, before slashing into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one defender before outrunning several more at the edge of the Brighton box.
He then pushed a pass to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We spoke about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League scuffle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton territory on that play.
He sent a beautiful through ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling toward the far post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before sliding out of bounds.
City battles Hoffenheim in Champions League group play at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point I would face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and would be pitching on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The President obliquely referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"All of what we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by using any means necessary, you see the meanness, the nastiness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And you see that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and nasty and untruthful."
He referenced Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name, which received loud boos from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I wait one - that was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who speak their minds
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.
And that is not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would "be all right."
But that is not what I came into politics to do.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr go top
Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.
Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.
There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.
Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.
The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.
Still Game star looks set for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered he's been named as the director of a licensed restaurants company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final one in the show's run, and it appears Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official record listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade."
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are daubed with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still vivid - as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Those hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is of course expecting with a positive view the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favour - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have set it back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless it can trust US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals' leaders.
His comments come as US. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line in massive headwear on it's way to a High Street near you
If you want to upsize your hat collection or completely block out the sun then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled an array of wacky oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway which dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-popping creations down the catwalk.
The stand out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that swamped the models heads.
Other over-sized accessories included bejeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks- and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled scuba diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue the huge fashion statement- you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that the enormous bonnets could be making their way to high streets near you.
The out-sized hats come hot on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide brim that's been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was splashed across social media sent another big creation down the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model toting it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and topped with a white leather handle, was the stand out piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the high street for next summer - as the designer has made such a huge impact it would be hard to ignore the demand for the oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.
Languages now, as a subject choice, are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage.
Therefore more and more, language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future having a life-long skill such as this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vitally important to the country's future, so this must be mirrored in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is nearly over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But just how many minutes he'll play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers" official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers" six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a flurry of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold for his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast on Nov.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over sexual misconduct allegations with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary aim of this flurry of rallies is helping Republicans facing touch November elections gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than at competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day.
Europe have the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural screams of celebration got louder as his round went on, sinking a crucial putt to take match four all-square when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won them the match on 15 was met with a similar scream, the sort that tells you he believes that the American team is not out of this.
"You've really just got to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
It is all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd cements that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
Talk of European glory remains premature, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.
On Sunday, though, there is nobody to help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between pairings, the advice they give, the advice they don't and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team thus far and take a significant lead into the final day but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateside, had been doubting.
Europe take 10-6 lead into Ryder Cup final day
Europe will take a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfiring American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not eat into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have it al their own way though on a pleasant, breezy day south west of Paris.
Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a gritty 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles, although as holders Furyk's side need only draw to retain the trophy.
After being second-best for two days, however, a Sunday counter-attack looks as though it will be beyond them.
North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of war,"" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'
An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal downs Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.
While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post.
Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.
While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone.
Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it sure is popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise rogue cells as part of treatment
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in lab
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then reinjected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West Embarked on a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Appearance.
It Didn't Go Well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he went on a rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person and they say: "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had got a hard time backstage about his head wear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "You wanna see the sunken place?" saying that he would "put my superman cape on, because this means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments drew boos at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The entire studio fell dead silent."
West had been brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West got backing from head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MOB."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spewing ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change their name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge over Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits out at toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something's gone wrong' and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he feels 'quite strongly' about addressing the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?,' he said.
'What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, in terms of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: 'What's innate and what's taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they have to be this certain side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
Because clearly something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is 'done with battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on in,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.
Maxine Waters denies staffer leaked GOP senators' data, blasts 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators onto the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being pedaled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters" office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperment to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and serene."
Fleischer was appearing to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Big if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructible and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof
It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories.
He is of course the daft secret agent who despite his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades briefly clanging against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels as if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.
The perennially topical premise now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and embattled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as a schoolmaster in some posh establishment, but giving off-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operative: some nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.
English is whisked back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, hitched to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of getting things terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they create mayhem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly pulled out for that last sequence, but as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.
Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to claw back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire stake as a Labour government could make 'deductions' on the grounds of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, who stand to pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that allegation came out, said, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, appears set in stone.
"My mind's made up about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everybody she names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Anything to Decrease Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event which has a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised.
The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he has reportedly said.
And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "captive."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Hard Look" At Running For President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a run.
The poll showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it.
Other high profile Democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, has given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.
Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre in the gutted city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through waterlogged belongings, trying to salvage anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analyst have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote.
Those things can't be walked back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already been high; that's true.
But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds off of Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely upended overnight.
"We are not asking their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross cleric celebrated
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed Bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke."
"It's government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children's programming, " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to work this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it switched over there were a lot of texts going back and forth and they all were not friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise you the next time it's not going to happen.
We'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - like we normally do - and we tried to overdeliver for the fans and we just went over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness.
Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him.
Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.
And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.
I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see.
He provides a lot more than just play."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14½-13½.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.
You go full bore tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over till you've got the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."
Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's a different beast.
Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship postponed yet again
German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.
Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial €2.2 billion.
Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually "running out of deployment-capable ships."
The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats
New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as lawyers set to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no , no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man and all good," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers
The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."
She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president has prior to him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay on post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal have continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Undergoes Emergency Surgery After Suffering Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just kind of collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details on type/extent of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK with the extra cash used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters
The stamp duty rise will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it raise up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disgrace."
Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scotland manager at some stage.
The Scot, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sit third place in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.
That opportunity would only come, though, if I am successful in club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.
"I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing.
It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."

Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.
Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.
Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."
Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed growth in "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty per cent of pupils said they have a "main" account to show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they operate a sanitised "main" account to show parents, while also having private ones.
One mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old's daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of those admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing so many teenagers are tempted into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her wide-ranging experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has massive respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland would benefit hugely by bringing her on to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to act as a voice for athletes and I am hoping I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was left unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what degree.
Its been grueling work but made a full recovery, re-learned how to walk and today doing agility drills!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advert comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."
However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Such an out of touch advert."
Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."
"I think this is a genus idea.
I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.
So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.
The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would no doubt be "The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh,"" Ms. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket ("a garment thick with hubris," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't peel himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was sort of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.
U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d"état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued.
The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face several of these inflection points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.
The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.
Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."
Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they aren't taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to begin.
Talk to your spouse and the kids: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Hammer out your legal documents: Head off legal battles at the pass.
Get a health-care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you're unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You would select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills get paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies?
Spell out those details in a written plan so that you're ready.
"It's not just the financials that are in play, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will care for the dog?
Have that plan in place."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications knocked out, relief officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia sits on the seismically Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering up tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.
Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, for sure" when asked his plea, reported the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanour, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down with death tolls expected to rise in coming days.
The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami smashed on shore.
Federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK 'would have been out' by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.
He suggested Mr Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers.'
Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: 'I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition's not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop Chequers and start listening.'
In a pointed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally politicians must be made to 'feel the heat' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with doing that'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
'We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A smattering of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened.
'These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all of the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It is a complete farce.
There isn't such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to take a 'hard look' at running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she'll take a "hard look at running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might take on Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.
An attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University's campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, per 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.
The team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two," said Hamilton.
That Was Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and nasty and untruthful."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful," he said.
"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait one minute.
Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added, in an impression of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But her denial did not appear to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the nastiness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer hit two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars atoned for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead through strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side level before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute on 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game on 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became provider for Cownie's equaliser on 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took a lead into the first break when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again put them on level terms with a power play goal on 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure Hundreds On Plane Can Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people made it safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed put to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart breaks to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive
The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .
When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
NY nanny sues couple over firing after "racist" text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny they are racist, likening the suit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her gaffe, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing, and is seeking compensation to the tune of $350 a day for the six-month, live-in gig she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do stuff like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Likening the suit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going to go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, slamming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.
I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
On landing her daughter had been rushed to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly to say it was really bad, that she wasn't expected to make it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly petering out and leaving her system.
She had died some time before hand and this was it all shutting down.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all unfolding.
I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold it together."
Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, by now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - oblivious to the ordeal she was going through.
"No-one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and tears were falling the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel everyday," she said.
Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one to find his sibling after he had taken his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I continually worry that there's going to be a knock on effect."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he was feeling down or depressed or anything," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.
He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything."
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to work through it: "It rips a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we've all got to carry on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And Women Need to Wield It.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of fury spilling over, and she can't get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.
I am angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was brilliant."
Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and will be pleased because they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, figured there was no reason she shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fund-raising, and so she vowed that she wouldn't enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up.
"You would have thought I'd had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?""
How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year long war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe clinches Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they required to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, plunked his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, conceding his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds, becoming 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format begun in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the tournaments all-time winningest European with 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
So thankful for Thomas to pick me and believe in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team., and I'm happy I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia following the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who took down US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all-time, having won 14 major titles second to only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We scrapped.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
You have to tip your cap.
We got outplayed."
Red Tide Update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The newest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchier bloom conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which suggests decreasing concentrations.
A bloom the Red Tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Patches can be found about 10 miles offshore of Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites relative to last week.
Red Tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or offshore of Pinellas County have been reported in the past week, low to high concentrations offshore of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or offshore of Sarasota County, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or offshore of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
An extraordinarily open and unique picture of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's documentary feature film
This unique film created by Olga Špátová will premier in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In mid-September last year, I received a phone call from Ivanka and Karel Gott who asked me whether, after ten years, I would consider making another documentary about Karel's life. I didn't hesitate for a minute! I felt, and still feel, very honoured to work with a person who's managed to bask in the glory of the Czech cultural scene for over half a century, thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic modesty and immense diligence. I accepted the challenge to make a documentary feature about Karel Gott as a way to give back to this legendary singer, who has been bringing joy with his art to no less than three generations of listeners," film director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to our timely agreement and organization, the first day of shooting was as early as 22nd October last year, and the last scenes with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The aim has always been completely clear – to authentically capture Karel Gott, a phenomenal singer who is giving himself to his fans, a painter and, at the same time, a loving husband and father. A man who has been giving away joy with his songs to several generations for sixty years, not just in this country, but also in Europe, or rather across the entire world. A man who has found a way into the hearts and souls of his fans by simply being.
The film is not supposed to be a showcase of Karel Gott's undeniable fame and success. "This is the reason why we can't be comparing this film to my previous film, The Gott Phenomenon. They are both different. If nothing else, it's different in capturing another stage of Karel Gott's life, which will be very apparent in his personal, if not intimate, confession he gave us. This made us realize just what a legend we have had the privilege to work and spend time with, which really is quite indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The film-makers were filming Karel Gott during his shows, and while he was talking his fans here and in Hamburg. Most of the filming was done his home environment, whether it was Prague or his cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood and other places that played an important role in his life. The film will thus be completely authentic and unique, thanks to Karel Gott's honesty and openness.
"Olga has a great gift to work with her small team in a way which often allowed us to get carried away in the relaxed atmosphere, so we naturally let her into our private lives. This helped me start talking about topics which are relatively intimate. She and her husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, have become part of our family, in a way. Originally, we wanted to release the film in 2019, to mark my milestone birthday. But because I was having a lovely time with my family in the summer, I wanted to start shooting as late as possible. And as there was too much of me everywhere in 2019, I wanted the film to go to cinemas next spring. This documentary is a way of saying thank you to all my fans and those who have supported and accompanied me throughout my career," says about the film Karel Gott himself.
Up to sixty times less insects now than 40 years ago
No other class of animals is more abundant in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other insect species make up more than half of life on Earth. However, a growing number of reports claim that the insect kingdom is radically decreasing in size. A new scientific study on this topic was published earlier this week, suggesting that the situation is much more serious than people realized.
The study was based on a field research conducted in a rainforest in Puerto Rico, wherein US researchers recreated a research similar to one done in 1976. It is outlined right at the beginning of the report that there is "ten to sixty times less" insects in the rainforest today. The decline is apparent in the whole population, not in the number of species. The research did not focus just on insects but included all arthropods, as well. Decreasing numbers of insects cause a decline in the population of other fauna too, such as birds, frogs and lizards, due to their dependency on insects as part of the food chain.
The authors of the research attribute their findings directly to climate change. They say that the average air temperature in the rainforest has increased by two degrees Celsius in the past thirty years, and it is the warmer temperatures that have become the driving force behind the food web collapse. According to the team of researchers, the study shows that the impact of climate change on the tropical ecosystems can be much more profound than previously thought.
An extensive article about this report was published in the Washington Post on Monday. The new findings are presented right in the title of the article as hyper-alarming. "This is one of the most disturbing articles I have ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut told the newspaper, which quotes him as an independent expert.
Insect extinction is also happening in Europe. "The decline here is also proportionate," points out Lukáš Čížek of the Institute of Entomology at the Academy of Sciences. He says that besides the climate change, we should also take the changes in landscape into account, which play a significant role in Europe. "It has been going on here for much longer than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek explaining why the researchers could have found such a sharp decline in the rainforests compared to the 1970s.
Ondřej Houska's Czechs in Europe: Should Czechoslovakia have refused the Munich Agreement of 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
An undated picture of Adolf Hitler visiting a Czechoslovak frontier fortification. The purpose of the fortification was never to stop the German Army, but slow it down before the Allies got involved.
If Czechoslovakia had refused the Munich Agreement almost exactly 81 years ago and was consequently faced with an attack from the Germans, what would have removed the majority of Czechoslovak soldiers from the battlefield? German tanks, their Air Force or perhaps the artillery? Quite possibly none of those weapons, despite the Germans having an overwhelming superiority in all of the above over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak Army would probably have suffered their heaviest losses – because of blisters.
Police Union Chairman Štěpánek has resigned, he wants to live as a free person
Milan Štěpánek, the Chairman of the Independent Police Union, decided to leave his post, reported the Czech Radio's Radiožurnál on Friday. Štěpánek, who has been chairing the union since 2005, will remain in the post for further two months. After he has left the front office, he will continue to serve in the police force.
"I can confirm that I handed in my written notice of resignation to the board earlier this week, and will remain in the post with all engagements for further two months," Štěpánek told the Radiožurnál. "I made this decision freely as someone who doesn't want to be tied to the union forever and who wants to live a more peaceful life," he said naming the reasons for his resignation.
The Independent Union of the Czech Republic's Police Force represents members and employees of security forces and the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the Union joined in protests against budget cuts and in petitions calling for better conditions in security forces. In 2011, the Union got into a dispute with the then Interior Minister, Radek John, and set up a petition calling for him to step down. The leaders of the government coalition later agreed that John would step down from his ministerial post.
A Semily museum exhibition looks back at the Velvet Revolution
A mock recreation of a room from the normalization era, complete with a television screen showing scenes of the brutal police action taken against students in Prague on 17th November 1989. This is one of the displays that is part of the new Velvet Revolution exhibition in a museum in Semily. "Our main aim is to show what was happening in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said Tomáš Chvátal, the curator of the exhibition.
"I'd say that the atmosphere was essentially the same all around; the first demonstration in Semily took place on 22nd November, with more people gradually joining in every day," he said. At the beginning, some of the most active people were in a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, the only person from this town and its surrounding area to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečeks, who had been spreading the "A Few Sentences" petition. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum formed relatively quickly back then. "One of the Civic Forum's defining features was that a strong group of local doctors had become its members," said the curator.
Some 50 photographs, taken by Karel Bárta 30 years ago, will transport visitors back to the past events that took place in the town. A video recording of the general strike of 27th November 1989, shot by František Tomíček, has survived to this day and will be played in a loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas was also among those who spoke and sang during the demonstration that took place then. A number of banners preserved from that time have been loaned to the exhibition by the Semily archive. "Their slogans read: Let's Not Get Duped, From a Trough to a Trough, We Don't Want Violence," said Chvátal. Some changes were implemented very quickly in the town back then, such as reaching a decision in as early as December during a vote held in all of Semily that the town square would be called Rieger's from then on and the previous name, Gottwald's, would be rendered invalid.
The exhibition also shows what was happening before the November events. "In the first section we present what the situation was like before, i.e. the late normalization period, to both contemporary witnesses and students. I think we've managed to gather unique documents about Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plate from the then museum of the labour movement," said Chvátal. One of the rooms should give you an idea of how a living room in an ordinary household looked like in those days.
The last section of the exhibition is dedicated to what was happening after the Velvet Revolution. It focuses on the first free election. "We wallpapered one of the rooms with election campaign posters. Those who lived then can reminisce over posters like ‘To Europe With Us’, or you can see Václav Klaus over there below the Civic Forum logo with a beautiful motto ‘Everyone For Their Own Town," added the curator.
Our fans should stay positive, wishes Hašek. Sparta expect a great game in Pilsen
"We'll push our abilities right to the edge and do everything in our power to succeed. We want to succeed in terms of both the game and the results," Sparta's Martin Hašek promised in an interview for the football club's TV channel.
He scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 win in a cup competition match in Jihlava earlier this week. Sparta have advanced to the next round, which they had to do. They are relieved, but as for the game, they are still worried.
In spite of the season slowly entering its second third, AC Sparta are still trying to find the identity Václav Jílek talked about when he was first appointed as their coach.
"It is still Sparta, though, and they do have some very good players. We have a difficult match ahead of us," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
The last time Sparta were in Štrunc Park, in mid-May playoffs, it was quite a clear-cut affair. The guests left after a dull performance with a 0-4 slaughter, the biggest defeat in the history of the Czech independent league.
While the difference between the clubs was eight points in the league table before the mutual match, Sparta have now lost nine points following the ten matches played in the new season. This is one of the worst entries into a season of all times.
"This situation is not easy for us or our fans, who would rather see their beloved club in an entirely different position than we are now," Hašek feels. "But we would be happy if they carried on supporting us, stayed positive and stuck up for us."
Sparta don't know whether they will be able to line up Tetteh, who has to serve a two-match suspension and is thus banned from playing in the Pilsen match. However, he appealed against the ban on Friday.
A number of players remain on the injury list: Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one on the roster to remember Sparta's last victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The only player not to line up on the home side is their midfielder Čermák. In addition to the cup victory in Hlučín on Wednesday, the home team have also won the last five matches. Jakub Brabec, a Sparta-grown defender, is to lead them in the match as their captain.
Download Metro 2033 Redux and Everything on your PC for free, you have time till Thursday
Both games are available on Epic Store via the link here. You can include the games in your library directly through the website. However, you'd need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play the game. You can do so until 3rd October.
Metro 2033 Redux is a modified version of the original game from 2010, enhanced with graphic and gameplay changes from the Last Light iteration.
The story, based on a Dmitry Glukhovsky book of the same name, is set in the aftermath of a nuclear war in Russia in 2033. The Earth's surface as we know it does not exist anymore. Humans had to take refuge below the ground, in this case the vast space of the Moscow Metro.
"Take a post-apocalyptic world and the gloomy atmosphere of an unknown place, make the area of the world smaller, add loads of spectacular scripts and action passages, and ta-da: Metro 2033 is here," we wrote on Bonusweb in our review back then.
In contrast, Everything is a relaxing ‘non-game’ game set in a procedurally generated world, carrying the legacy of English author and philosopher Alan Watts. Gamers can become anything, from animals over trees to a planet.

"A dreadful outcome of a study." Islam does not belong in the West, the overwhelming majority of Austrians think
A survey, in which 1200 respondents were polled, has shown that there is considerable mistrust towards Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 per cent of Austrian residents are concerned that some Muslims may be terrorists and 48 per cent want to impose a ban on building mosques. Eighty per cent of the respondents want to increase the surveillance of Islamic centres.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to have their religious practices limited and claim that they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country due to the presence of Muslims.
"The outcome of this study is dreadful," says the author of the study, Wolfgang Aschauer, and adds: "This tendency towards ethnocentrism may give rise to discriminatory attitudes over time. There is a danger that the religious freedom granted to Muslims will be curbed."
Religious respondents were less critical in their attitudes. Aschauer claims that in Austria, this conflict is not between religions but between cultures. According to the sociologist, education and dialogue could help ease the polarization.
The study has shown that the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are felt among extreme-right voters, people without a university degree and senior citizens over 75. In contrast, voters of the Green Party, people under 30 and those with a university degree have shown the friendliest attitudes.
Austria's Ministry of the Interior estimates that there are approximately 700 thousand Muslims living in Austria, a country of about 8.7 million residents. The vast majority of the Muslims there have Turkish roots. There are over 400 Muslim prayer rooms and mosques. Islam has been recognized as an official religion here since 1912.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of a hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees not deemed sufficient
This week, the Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency. The future of the Czech branch is being currently discussed. A decision should be reached by the end of September.
According to Jan Papež, the Deputy Chair of the Association of Travel Agencies in the Czech Republic, there are three possible solutions in this scenario – to declare liquidation, to sell the company or to found a new travel agency by the Czech branch's team. "However, it is not possible to predict which option will be chosen. That will depend on the German owner," he said to the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to having terminated two package holidays early, the travel agency is also dealing with cases where clients had to pay for their accommodation out of their own pockets despite the company's efforts to provide guarantees to the hotel owners. The travel agency promised it would cover their clients' expenses since the company has sufficient funds to do so, according to Papež.
The problems with hotels emerged mainly in Mallorca, where the company even had to seek help at the Czech consulate. In this context, Papež described to the Czech News Agency one case where all tourists who were clients of the travel agency were kicked out of the local hotel. "The hotel owner couldn't tell who'd come with the German company and who with the Czech one. Therefore he kicked all of them out of the hotel even though this country's Neckermann had provided guarantees to them," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was resolved in the end.
The Czech branch of the collapsed British Thomas Cook Group increased its revenues up to 995 million Czech crowns last year, a growth of nearly 21 per cent year-on-year, as shown in the company's annual report. It includes the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. By contrast, the net profit of the company was reduced by roughly seven million, i.e. to 15.3 million Czech crowns. However, the company has unsettled financial losses of nearly 103 million Czech crowns from previous years. The branch includes two basic divisions – in addition to the Neckermann Travel Agency, there is also a company called Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump considers delisting Chinese shares from the USA
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, an informed source told Reuters today. This measure would be a radical escalation of the USA and China trade tensions. Following the news, shares of the companies concerned slumped instantly in the New York Stock Exchange and took the entire market down with them.
The delisting move would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in China, the source added. They thus confirmed the information reported by Bloomberg, which had sent shock waves through the financial markets shortly before that. Shares of the Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI declined by two to four per cent.
According to government data, 156 Chinese companies were listed on the Nasdaq and NYSE as of February, including at least 11 state-owned companies.
Bloomberg pointed out that there is currently no precise mechanism that would ensure delisting shares of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. Any plan is subject to approval by Trump, who has given the green light to the discussion on the matter.
China and the USA have been in a trade war for over a year now, which saw them both impose tariffs on one another's goods. The dispute has had negative impacts on the global economy and raises concerns of a recession of the global economy. By imposing tariffs, Washington tries to make Beijing change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the USA.
According to the CNBC TV website, business talks between the USA and China should be renewed on 10th October. Their goal is to end the trade war.
CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác accused by the police over promotion contracts
The police have accused Aleš Pangrác, the former manager of the state-run CzechTourism agency, over promotion contracts. Pangrác has confirmed to the Seznam Zprávy online newspaper that he received the accusation earlier this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that the police were investigating contracts worth 38 million Czech crowns in this police case. According to the police, some of the money was being returned to Pangrác, the newspaper website informs. As part of the investigation, crime investigators were also interested in the Minister of Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (ANO), whose department CzechTourism falls under. The newspaper website reports that the investigation is still ongoing.
Detectives from the National Centre for Combating Organized Crime were collecting evidence pertaining to this case in the second half of November last year. Among the places they were looking into were the seat of the Ministry of Regional Development, the head office of CzechTourism, a racing track in Most and the Sport Invest Agency. They also took away the Minister's company computer from her apartment. The court warrant permitting to search Dostálová's home, which she had quoted to Czech Television earlier, stated that the Minister was making decisions in 2016, when she was Deputy Minister, in the matter of CzechTourism's expenditures in favour of selected persons via a third party and outside the officially-recognized standard procedures. Dostálová claimed then that she felt absolutely innocent and there had been no wrongdoing on her part. She also said that she was able to supply documentation to prove it, and that she fully cooperated with the police.
The agency claims this is a case of misconduct by an individual person. The media reported earlier that this issue concerned the former director of the regional partnership department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed because of audit findings. These revealed that CzechTourism had entered into 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, I have been accused. But I will make no further comment on the matter," said Pangrác to Seznam Zprávy.
A Dobruška cemetery vandalized
According to the report received by the police, the act of vandalism in the garden of remembrance in a cemetery in Dobruška was purportedly committed on Wednesday between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
"The material damage has been calculated to be 60 thousand Czech crowns. The police officers are now asking potential witnesses to come forward and give information either in person at the police station or by phoning the free 158 line," said Lucie Konečná, a police spokeswoman.
The investigators treat the case as damage to somebody else's property and disorderly conduct, which is punishable by up to three years of prison.
Hundreds of enslaved children freed from a faith school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys in the school. Reuters has reported that there were over three hundred children aged five and more, based on the information given by a police commissioner. Some were chained to each other, while others were chained to iron wheels on the walls.
Kaduna Police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the school was raided after a tip-off. He described it as a "house of horror". The starved people were forcibly kept in, tortured and sexually abused. Leaving the school was prevented by a razor wire above the walls. He said this was human slavery.
Several people were arrested during the raid. Yakubu Sabo, a police spokesman, said the arrested people were the teachers at that school.
The children told the police that it was their parents or relatives who had sent them there in the belief that this was a faith school. "We identified two children who had come from Burkina Faso. However, most of them were brought here by their parents from the Nigerian states in the north," said spokesman Sabo about the identity of the victims. The northern Nigerian states are predominantly Muslim.
The Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal School presented itself as a faith school teaching the Quran.
The freed people have been moved to a stadium, where they now receive help and food provisions. Some of them were reunited with their relatives.
A French chef sues Michelin over star demotion. I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, only a year after he won the rating. He is taking legal action against the red guide publisher to determine the exact reasons behind the demotion. Veyrat has also questioned the competence of the Michelin inspectors who he says had mistaken saffron for cheddar. The first court hearing is set for November.
The head chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy was stripped of one of his three Michelin stars in January this year. He is taking the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin to court as he thinks that the inspectors' conclusion was not properly founded. What's more, the star was demoted without any prior notice, says the chef. "I have been depressed for six months now. How dare you gamble with the health of chefs?" Veyrat sent a message to the inspectors.
The chef was reportedly given only vague reasons by Michelin, one of which was that the head chef had added cheddar in his souffle, something the inspectors did not like. "I put saffron in it, and these gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I have loved working with Savoy ingredients since I started this business," Veyrat protested against the decision. He is convinced that the Michelin inspectors were profoundly incompetent: "You are impostors who only want clashes, for commercial reasons." Outraged Veyrat does not understand "how they dared to say that we put cheddar in our souffle". "They have insulted our region; my employees were furious. Our eggs come from our own chickens, our milk from our own cows, and our gardeners pick fresh herbs every morning," he ranted.
The distinctive chef, complete with his black hat and dark glasses, opposes the new generation of Michelin inspectors, and that's why he is now asking for his restaurant to be removed from the red guide. However, the publisher has refused to do so. "If you remain in business and our inspectors will choose it again, we'll keep recommending it," claims Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's International Director.
According to Michelin, the head chef's complaint still doesn't include any meaningful accusations, and say that his layer should help him formulate it. "We regret Mr Veyrat communicates with us in an abrasive manner. Nevertheless, we'll examine his objections thoroughly," he said.
Beside La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart also owns other two three-star restaurants.
Technologically perfect mess with a weak screenplay. Gemini Man with Will Smith has failed to impress the critics
The dystopian sci-fi movie Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise – Will Smith is faced with a younger version of himself. According to critics, though, the storyline is the weakest point of the film. The motion picture will be shown in Czech cinemas on 10th October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is a top professional in his field. He kills effectively, no questions asked. One day, he decides to hang up his hat and retire. Understandably, this doesn't go well with his employers, who send a killer after him. But there is a catch – the killer is Henry himself, or rather his younger clone created from his DNA. Is one determined man going to win a battle with himself? In this case, literally.
Some level of quality should have been guaranteed by the three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. Even though this is his first sci-film, he has had plenty of experience with drama action films, which he showed in films such as the aforementioned ‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’ and the western film ‘Ride with the Devil’. As many as six screenwriters worked on the script. The best known of them would certainly be David Benioff, one of the creators of the mega-successful Game of Thrones. Based on the first reactions, though, all of this wasn't enough to make a good movie.
"Even though Ang Lee is attempting huge things technically, this film in itself doesn't have enough character to carry them," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan from the Screen Daily website.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. Its weak script and plot are only held together by the technological wizardry of the film-makers," Stephen Dalton summed up his opinion in The Hollywood Reporter.
"Gemini Man is a case in which an awful lot of effort has gone into making an awfully lazy action movie," writes Peter Deburge, a Variety reviewer who doesn't hide his disillusionment.
"A baffling product born from a bizarre idea," concluded Ella Kemp of the IndieWire website in her review.
"It's difficult to care that one man is a doppelganger of the other when neither of them acts very human," wrote Nicholas Barber on The Wrap website.
An overview of children's bank accounts available on the Czech market
Banks provide children's bank accounts free of charge. However, thought should be given to the options available, as some of the additional account services are subject to a charge. "The banks' motivation to offer children's accounts, whose basic maintenance is usually provided free of charge, is straightforward. Financial institutions count on getting the exempted charges back in the future. Considering the fact that Czechs do not migrate between banks very much, they are probably right in their presumption," says Kristýna Kuncová of the dTest.
According to her, "Junior Accounts" can do almost everything bank accounts for adults can. Children are provided with their own payment card, they can make payments, watch the movement of the money on their accounts, and in some accounts they can do their own online banking. While the banks are happy to set up the accounts, it is the parents who are expected to teach their children how to use it and control how much their children spend.
"Parents can fairly flexibly set up weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and so on. Most importantly, they can follow what's happening on the account, either on the internet or by receiving information via text messages. Keep in mind though that these services may not be necessarily free of charge," adds Kuncová and continues: "If parents are thinking about opening an account for their child, they should evaluate the child's skills and capabilities."
Strict but fair, we enjoy his lessons! That's how Benešov Grammar School students see their favourite teacher/author
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. The secondary school teacher of Czech and History is also a poet, prosaist and revivalist of literary life in a small town.
When reading Pavel Hoza's work, Bohuslav Reynek springs to mind. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, albescent rural houses, wavering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old country lanes and people who have been walking on them for centuries. Grieving, cursing, blessing. This present-day successor of Reynek teaches Czech, Literature and History at the grammar school in Benešov. He runs a version of Prague Viola in the local ‘Na Slovíčko’ Café and organizes the annual Benešov Festival of Literature.
Wife Swap: Ondra cruelly abused by his parents! He ended up in an institution
It was nerve-racking. Supposedly a problematic son, Ondřej (9), was often severely punished by his father. "He came home from school and told a fib about his snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that the boy would have to kneel as a punishment," described Lucie in the Swap. Dad Lukáš forced young Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! When the cameras weren't rolling, the boy even had to suffer like this on a wooden foot-massage board! "Ondřej approached me after the shoot and said – Auntie, I get into trouble and get disciplinary notes only to be able to leave here, because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when it fully dawned on her what was going on in the studio flat behind closed doors. In the end, the boy's wish came true...
His situation was so serious that he was taken away from the family when the filming came to an end and was placed in the Children's Care Centre in České Budějovice for a month. He returned to his father and stepmother Aneta (28) for a short time; however, he then went to a detention institution for problematic children. "When I came home, Aneta added me on Facebook right away, and we wrote to each other for a while. She was mainly interested in whether we'd received any money. I pretty much didn't respond to that. But then she wrote that the boy was in an institution, and that he was later returned to stay with them, and now he is in a detention centre. They are both unemployed," claims mum Lucie, who lives in the Pilsen area.
The Blesk naturally contacted the other party but was only met with a vague reply. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick. Call back later," Aneta said as an excuse and hung up.
Sparta want Tetteh in the line-up in Pilsen. They appeal against a two-match ban
AC Sparta have appealed against the two-match ban the disciplinary committee gave their striker, Benjamin Tetteh, for being sent off at the derby match against Slavia (0-3) on Sunday.
The Letná club has posted this information on their Twitter account and is now waiting for a decision to be reached by the disciplinary committee.
Tetteh has already served the first half of the ban at the Wednesday match of the home cup in Jihlava. Sparta are now seeking to line the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker up for the big match of the 11th round in the First League in Pilsen on Sunday.
Last year's October situation may be repeated now. Last October, Olomouc appealed against the ban Šimon Falta received from the disciplinary committee on Thursday, suspending him for one match for being sent off in a match against Liberec.
As the appeal committee did not have enough time to discuss the case, the ban was postponed, and Falta could line up on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The committee confirmed the one-match ban for the Olomouc midfielder on the following weekend, and Falta sat out the next match against Zlín.
The committee has suspended Tetteh for a foul on Slavia's David Hovorka, and was immediately shown the red card by the referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The Ghanaian player's alleged spitting on the captain of the opposing team, Tomáš Souček, has not been proved.
Keller elected as President of the German Football Association
As anticipated, Fritz Keller, the former boss of the Bundesliga's Freiburg, has become the new President of the German Football Association. The 62-year-old winemaker, gourmet and hotel owner was unanimously elected for the next three years, running unopposed in the election.
Keller has replaced Reinhard Grindel, who stepped down in April in the wake of his undisclosed income affair. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go to court for bribery allegations in connection with the awarding of the 2006 World Championship hosting rights.
Keller said that one of the major goals for him is to reinstate trust in the Association and steer it out of the crisis. "This is not going to be a One-Man Show; many people will have to share responsibility. The Association is better than its current reputation is," said Keller, who had presented all his tasks under the motto: We can do it together.
Upon his election as President of the Association, Keller resigned from his post at Freiburg.
A fire outbreak in the ČSA underground mine at Karviná, no injuries sustained
A fire in the ČSA underground mine at Karviná broke out this morning. The cause of the fire is yet unknown. Nobody was hurt in the fire, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told the ČTK.
The fire broke out in a drift roughly 1,200 metres below the surface at 4.25 a.m. "No employees were injured, nobody was hurt. Mine rescue workers responded immediately to the fire, which was put out by direct attack. They also examined the area. The site was locked down immediately, and access to it was blocked," said the spokesman. The exact cause of the fire outbreak will now be investigated by a special committee.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná coal district, coal is now extracted only in the Karviná section – in the ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South mines. Coal mining is due to finish in the Lazy Mine this year, while the operation of the other mines is to be gradually phased out. The OKD mining company is the only producer of black coal in Czechia. The company produced 4.62 million tonnes of coal last year. Around 9 thousand people work in the mine.
Berlin responds to the pressure from the public and deals with the housing crisis. Six thousand flats to be bought from a private company
Berlin is set to buy six thousand former social-housing flats from ADO Properties SA, a private Luxembourg company, for 920 million Euros (23.8 billion Czech crowns), which were sold by the city council 15 years ago. The council responds to the pressure from the public who are protesting against skyrocketing prices of rents. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher from The Left Party (Die Linke), this is the biggest purchase of this kind in the history of Germany's capital city. The opposition criticizes the measure.
"Our intention is to keep the rents stable in Berlin and provide tenants with security," said the Berlin Mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), in a statement. "At the same time, we'll continue to build new flats and make legal provisions to freeze the rents," he added. Gewobag, a council-owned company, will take over the thousands of flats, located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city, this December.
According to Thomas Rothäusler, an analyst from the Jefferies company, the city paid too much. Rothäusler told the Bloomberg news agency that he estimated the city had paid for the housing units roughly ten per cent over their account value.
According to the German opposition liberal party (FDP), the measures taken by the Berlin authorities will lead to increased speculation in the property market. The FDP posted this on its Twitter account on Friday. The protest party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has described the measure as "a waste of money".
Gewobag repurchased 670 flats in Berlin's street Karl-Marx-Allee as early as mid-July, reminded the Der Spiegel weekly news magazine on its website. The municipal board did not make the price public then. The controversy around the flats in the former showpiece avenue, built during the GDR times, was accompanied by protests and was filling the front pages of the German press. The controversy has become the symbol of the depressing situation tenants in large German cities are faced with, stated the paper.
Although the German metropolis used to be renowned for its low cost of living and low rents, in recent years it has been gaining in popularity. According to the AFP agency, the rents have doubled in the past ten years making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
A Brno company sued by Nokia over the name Lokia. People not likely to confuse the brands, believe the Moravians
Nokia has lodged an objection to an application to register the name Lokia at the Industrial Property Office. However, according to CCV the products are not likely to be confused for one another.
CCV, a software developer company in Brno, faces a legal action from Nokia, a Finnish manufacturer of telecommunication devices. The Finns oppose the name of the warehouse management program, Lokia WMS, developed by the Brno company, the E15 daily newspaper reported. Nokia has therefore lodged an objection to the application to register the name Lokia at the Industrial Property Office. CCV thinks that the brands are not likely to be confused for one another.
Marketing director Petr Ondrášek said that the program has been on the market since last September and is now used by twenty costumers.
"The Nokia brand is recognised and trusted all over the world. When somebody tries to register a name which we think could lead to confusion or weakening our brand, we will take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia's spokesman, Mark Durrant.
The Brno developers claim they did not have the brand, which was renowned for their mobile phones in the past, in mind when creating the warehouse management program. According to CCV, the name Lokia comes from the Latin name of a dragonfly species whose fast movement is meant to be an analogy of the movement of storeroom workers in warehouses.
"It is highly unlikely there would be confusion over the names on the Czech market. We sell state-of-the-art cloud software used by companies to run their warehouse systems. We really have no ambition to target the mobile phone manufacturing sector. In addition, we do not seek to be compared to a brand that is perhaps losing its grip in the mobile phone industry," Tomáš Kormaňák, the manager of CCV, told the E15.
CCV filed an application to have the brand name protected at the Industrial Property Office back in August, before the program was released to the market. "An application was lodged to have our products and services protected in classes 9, 35 and 42. According to the international classification system, software is in class 9, services related to warehouse business management are in class 35, and computer software development is in class 42," said Ondrášek.
Nokia bases its objection on the fact that the older Nokia trademark applies to all classes of products and services, covering the broadest possible spectrum of products and services, and thus also includes classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not dispute the claims made by the objecting party as regards the agreement on the products and services classes. However, in reality these are completely different brands focusing on different target groups," said Ondrášek.
According to the E15, the dispute over the brand name can last for months, which can complicate the business activities of the company.
From Sydney to London in four hours? This may be a reality in 2030
Sabre combines a traditional aeroplane engine with a rocket engine. It has been designed to propel an aircraft twice the speed of Concorde. "When the Sabre engine is up and running, we could be able to get to Australia in roughly four hours," said Turnock. The aircraft could also travel the distance, for example, between London and New York in one hour.
The Independent server notes that this hypersonic travel, which is the equivalent of five times the speed of sound, is difficult because of engine overheating. Sabre (the Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) deals with this problem by using supercooled helium to keep temperatures from rising.
"The main thing with Sabre is that it's a hybrid of a rocket engine and an aeroplane engine, which is propelled with a current of exhaust gases created from air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets really have not progressed in the past 70 years, whereas aeroplane engines have done. So, if you combine the two engines, you can have a very lightweight and efficient propulsion system, and basically create a space plane," he added.
Trials of the engine are currently taking place, with plans to start launching test flights in mid-2020. Commercial flights could be in place by around 2030.
Kovosvit to sell its administration building and other halls in expectation of worse to come
The restructuring of Kovosvit resulted in the company's consolidated loss of 100 million Czech crowns last year, while the consolidated turnover came to 1.3 billion. According to Kuchař, some of the key problems that emerged last year was the lack of staff and shifting subcontractors. We experienced a decreased demand for machine tools by 10 to 20 per cent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decrease in turnover by about ten per cent," said the Director General. In 2017, Kovosvit's sales were 1.3 billion Czech crowns, and the post-tax profit was 40.1 million. The loss in 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit is now selling a number of properties, halls and some land, which the company either does not use at all or uses only to a minimal extent. This is also the case of the administration building, where out of the five floors only two are used by Kovosvit, and not even fully. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit and increase its efficiency. The sale of the assets is not part of a momentary solution for, let's say, the cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan whereby we're seeking to put all resources into investment development," said the Director General.
Kovosvit exports about a half of its products. Its standard markets are usually in the EU and Russia, and last year, to a lesser extent, in Asia. This year, Kuchař regards India to be one of the most interesting markets. Kovosvit was awarded a contract for five-axis machining devices worth 100 million Czech crowns in India. The company also exported two five-axis machines worth 30 million Czech crowns to China this year. "Another contract at a similar volume is under negotiation right now, which we are looking into fulfilling before the end of this year," said Kuchař. Kovosvit is faced with limitations on markets in Russia and some other countries due to imposed sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres in France – to a company that is subcontracted by Airbus. Kovosvit supplied another machine to them in May earlier this year, and one more is to follow either at the end of this year or the beginning of 2020.
The company's main investment this year was the switch from a steam heating system to a hot-water heating system worth 20 million Czech crowns. There are 500 people employed in Kovosvit, and the average wage of a worker is 28,500 Czech crowns. The company is looking for foundry casting grinders, machinists, lathe operators and electricians.
The company has been under ownership of industrialist and arms manufacturer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. Machining tools have traditionally been manufactured here. It was established by Tomáš Baťa in 1939. The company used to employ up to three thousand people back in the day.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was hijacked by the Army! Andor Šándor claims
The circumstances around the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů remain unclear. The media speculated earlier this week that the Army had been planning a spectacular farewell ceremony – in the grand way soldiers do these things – in order to say last goodbye to the Deputy Head of the Military Intelligence Agency in spite of the wishes of his family. There was also confusion around the date of the funeral. The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, Jan Pejšek, has denied the claims.
"That's nonsense! We've been in touch with the family since the beginning. The funeral will be held on Friday as previously arranged. There were no changes made to the date, and the military salutes are also on. The only issue we'll address, in consideration of the family, is the potential presence of the media," said Pejšek to the Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will indeed be held on Friday, and all military salutes, including fighter planes in the sky, will be part of the ceremony.
Nevertheless, tensions around the farewell ceremony for the popular General are still there. Due to a decision made by the organizers, people who used to work with the General will not be present at the funeral service!
Among those is Andor Šándor (62), the former Head of the Military Intelligence Agency, who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as being hard-working and intelligent, and "a good chap".
Moreover, in recent years he was regularly meeting him at events celebrating anniversaries of the founding of the Military Intelligence Agency. That's precisely why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "Personally, I would like to attend Milan Jakubů's funeral," said Šándor to the Blesk. But he can't.
"I am also aware of other people from the organization who would like to go but are in tough luck, because the potentates are usurping the funeral just for themselves. I think it isn't right for them to appropriate the funeral like that," said the security expert. He also thinks there is something dodgy about the allegedly planned exclusion of the public from the ceremony due to keeping the army elites secret.
"The leaders of the Army are not kept secret, and neither are the senior military intelligence officers, as they can be seen, for instance, at Prague Castle when they are promoted to a higher rank. If the information given by the media is correct and the family did indeed allow to be side-lined by the Army, that is naturally the family's private business. I would personally never let the Army to take over the family and their wishes," concluded Šándor.
Milan Jakubů died in a car crash near Špindlerův Mlýn on Saturday. The head-on collision between Milan's Rapid and a Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car, Vojtěch C. (31).
The amateur racer is reported to have driven into the opposite direction when he entered a bend. Milan Jakubů had, in all likelihood, no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the crash and may have consequences lasting for the rest of her life. The police questioned the driver at fault on Thursday.
Jan Šindelář's commentary: Running the railways like a business
Granting that the election of Nebeský may not have been entirely smooth, it is still the climax of a sad story about the government's failure to give the Railways a clear direction. The Board of Directors has been incomplete for over a year now and will remain so even after Wednesday evening due to one member's resignation. Provisional measures are still in place.
The selection process itself was a farce from the start, the main reason being that the requirements on the candidates had been substantially relaxed in terms of their level of experience. In contrast to last year's selection process, the requirements on the size of the company the candidates had worked for in the past were lowered. Members of the selection committee were reduced to puppets, and so were the members of the supervisory board later.
Nebeský produced perhaps the weakest CV in terms of professional experience out of the five finalists. Despite his lack of experience in a large company he still managed to shove aside seasoned top dogs from front office positions in logistics giants and transport companies. It was the presence of the interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest feature (and the biggest hope) of the whole process. Now they know their role there was only to be a theatrical backdrop for a political stage play.
It could be that Nebeský will surprise us and prove to be very talented indeed. He may become the best railway chief of all times in the end. However, he will be associated with the bad aftertaste of political cronyism, at least in the early days. The Czech Railways face tough times ahead, as they have to deal with the competition emerging in the wake of market liberalization and the lack of operational staff. There aren't enough train drivers, train shunters and mechanics. How can they stay motivated to work there and respect the management when the government acts like a bull in a china shop in their approach to top leadership matters?
Another important group are the creditors. We will see their take on what's being played out in the top management of the Railways in spring next year, when the Railways will be defending their credit rating. What's clear is that the creditors do notice instability. It is unfortunate that every year a different person is sent to the Moody's agency by the Czech Railways to defend their credit rating. The frequent changes in the management of the Railways and the political influence on the company did not escape the agency's attention – they criticized the Railways for this as early as this summer.
The ANO movement's motto is, among others, that a country should be run like a business. For starters, it would suffice if they ran one big state-owned company like a business, and not like a country. The Czech Railways are still one of the largest companies in this country. It would be great if it was run by those who are the best fit for the job. Such people did apply, but the government turned them down. Granted, it could be said that the top post in the Railways has always been a matter of politics. But then we should be spared the buffoonery with selection procedures.
A couple taped a female dog and drowned it in a river, the sack was found by children
The incident occurred in a small town near Valašské Klobouky in late July. A 27-year-old woman brought home a one- or two-year-old dog she had been given as a present with a view to looking after it. The woman's partner, who is ten years older than her, did not like the fact that the dog was female, so he decided to get rid of it.
"He bound an adhesive tape and rope around the animal, and substantially restricted the sound coming from it. He placed the dog in a jute sack and tied it. He and the woman then took the animal to a river and threw the sack with the animal inside in the water. At the time of throwing, the dog was demonstrably still alive," said Monika Kozumplíková, a spokeswoman for the Zlín Police.
Next day, some children who were playing near the river found a jute sack on the riverside. When they opened it, they found the body of a dead dog inside. They therefore called out to a woman who happened to be passing by, and then ran away. The woman called the police on the emergency 158-line and reported the incident.
"Because the police officers knew the town's residents, they realized who could be the likely perpetrators of this incredible act. They were not mistaken. The man and the woman confessed to the act and described how it happened," added the police spokeswoman.
An expert veterinary medical report has confirmed that the dog died in an unambiguously excruciating way as a result of suffocation. The animal had suffered for several minutes before it died.
"The actions undertaken by the perpetrators show beyond doubt that they clearly intended to rid themselves of the animal in this despicable way by any means, even though they could have gifted or sold the dog to somebody. The superintendent of the Zlín Criminal Investigation Police charged the couple with a criminal offence of cruelty to animals committed in complicity. Both accused are first-time offenders and could be sentenced to up to three years behind bars if found guilty," noted Kozumplíková.
Thanks for the Dance! Singer Leonard Cohen's last album to be released posthumously
The album titled ‘Thanks for the Dance’ will feature unheard material and various musical collaborations, put together by his son. The album will be released on 22nd November.
In October 2016, ‘You Want it Darker’ was released, an album Cohen had created together with his son Adam. Cohen asked his son to complete the individual songs. Through this intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his approaching death. He died at the age of 82, a month after the album's release.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the material his father had left him. He invited a whole host of musicians to collaborate on the album – Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas and the singer Beck, to name a few.
"In composing the music for my father's lyrics, we chose his most characteristic musical signatures. In this way, he is still with us," said Adam Cohen about the album. "What moves me most about the album is the response of those who have heard it. They say, one after the other, that Leonard still lives," he added.
The album's release has been trailed with a short song ‘The Goal’. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost at home," Cohen sings with his distinctive honeyed voice. He sang about death as he expected he was not going to live to see the new material released. He even admitted it in an interview for The New Yorker a month before his death. "I am ready to die. I hope it's not too uncomfortable," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published ‘The Flame’, a collection of his father's poems. In Czech, it will be published as ‘Plamen’ by Argo Publishing on 31st December.
The first Miss contest winner Christová finally shapes up: Looking fab after shedding a few kilos
The first modern-era winner of the Miss beauty contest in 1989, Ivana Christová (49), has struggled with her weight for many years. Her weight was the root of her physical problems and, in particular, mental problems. She was really unhappy about how much she had changed since the Miss Czechoslovakia contest. However, it now looks like she has taken the criticism to heart and decided to fight the extra kilos – despite being in it for the long haul.
She used to be a first-class beauty, who even conquered Paris. Nevertheless, thirty years have passed since then, and Ivana Christová can only reminisce about the beauty contest. Not just about her fame, but also about how skinny she used to be then.
As the time went by she started to disregard the strict modelling rules whereby she had to stay as skinny as possible and often skipped meals. She decided to stop obeying those rules and start eating whatever she fancied.
So, she moved from starving herself to eating excessively, which left its mark on her figure right away. She tried to hide the extra kilos with all kinds of loose clothing, but this made her curvy body look even bigger.
Now it looks like Ivana really means business. She has visibly lost weight, started to dress with taste and wears clothes that are more appropriate for a fuller figure.
Her new look surprised all who were at the launch of Miloš Zapletal's (75) book. She has regained her original features of the charming brunette who entered history in 1989, not only with her winning the first Miss contest held after the revolution but also with the controversy her win had caused.
Christová will always be remembered as the first beauty contest winner. She is also the very first winner, whose crowning was accompanied by a huge uproar from insanely whistling spectators in the Palace of Culture and Sports in Ostrava.
"A travesty of justice." The scientist who claimed that pollution causes cancer is now in jail in Turkey
Between 2011 and 2015, Sik and other scientists worked on a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health. The outcomes of the study revealed that the pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the western parts of the country is linked to an increased occurrence of cancer in local residents.
The scientists particularly highlighted the Dilovasi industrial zone that holds a number of chemical and metallurgical plants, situated some 80 kilometres away from Istanbul. According to the scientists, people who live in the zone's vicinity suffer from cancer well above the international average.
Erdogan is taking revenge for the coup despite international criticism
Sik observed that the government was not taking any measures in the matter despite the clear results of the study. This was the reason behind him publishing several articles about the research in the opposition daily newspaper, Cumhuriyet. As a result of that, the authorities began a prosecution against him for leaking confidential information.
"The study has clearly shown the extent of the contamination of water sources by toxic substances," said Sik to journalists after the verdict was delivered. "The decision of the court shows that the findings of studies that directly concern public health can be concealed. That's unacceptable," added the scientist.
"Instead of using courts to chase after people who raise the alarm, the Turkish authorities should inquire into this significant public health problem," stated Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organizations have been accusing the Turkish government for a long time now of not enforcing any environmental regulations despite the fast industrial development in some regions.
Following the failed coup of 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime began a large wave of arrests. Nearly 80 thousand people are now behind bars, including a number of employees of the Cumhuriyet. The authorities also either suspended or completely dismissed 150 thousand government employees and armed forces personnel.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute their opponents. However, the authorities claim in their defence that these measures are necessary for national security.
The fastest man on the planet not available for tests. I don't take anything, he defends himself
The traditionally intensely watched race which determines the fastest man on the planet can become a chase for silver defender Christian Coleman at the World Championship. The 23-year-old American is leading the tables with a time of 9.81 seconds and only one loss this year. His start at the top of the season is under threat, though, due to the imbroglio involving him missing anti-doping tests.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) dropped his case in early September without bringing up accusations due to formal reasons. Coleman failed to attend three anti-doping tests last year, as well as this year; however, the missed appointments were more than 12 months apart. The first test he missed was backdated to 1 April 2018 by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), i.e. the start of the second quarter, even though the actual date of the missed test was 6th June. Because the date of the test he failed to turn up to was 29th April 2019, Coleman was not in violation of the rule of three missed appointments over the course of 12 months.
Coleman defended himself by saying that he merely forgot to update his ‘whereabouts’ application used by athletes. "I don't do drugs; I don't even take anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine and protein powders or various other supplements to be able to recover faster. And I don't take anything, I work hard, and that's just what it is," he said before the start of the World Championship.
The only time Coleman didn't win in this year's six starts at the 100-metre sprint was when he entered the season in the Diamond League in Shanghai. He was outperformed by his fellow countryman, Noah Lyles, only by six thousandths of a second. Lyles used Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League finals but will only run a 200-metre sprint in the World Championship.
On paper, the second fastest sprinter is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, with his time of 9.86 seconds, who has until now only been successful at U.S. university competitions.
Justin Gatlin, a 37-year-old American who managed a time of 9.87 seconds in Stanford this June, will be defending his title. His time in the last 100-metre sprint in Zagreb was only 10.29, due to a hamstring injury.
Among other front-runners are South African Akani Simbine; Andre de Grasse, who was a three-time winner at the Rio Olympics; and European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican is Yohan Blake, the 2011 world champion with a time of 9.96 seconds.
The men's 100 metres is set to start with a preliminary round and heats on Friday. The semi-finals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The sprint competition for medals will be held at 21:15 CEST.
A plane crashed near Žinkovy in the Pilsen area: Two people died in the accident
There were two people on board, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane requested clearance to land at Chaloupky Airport near Klatovy at 8.30 p.m.," said Dana Ladmanová, a police spokeswoman. This was their last recording. According to the GPS coordinates, the plane was somewhere above Vojovice near Žinkovy at the time.
However, the plane did not make it to Klatovy's airport. The search for the lost aeroplane, which had issued a distress signal, started immediately. "Our police helicopter was assisted by a military helicopter in the search process," said Martina Korandová, a police spokeswoman. The search operation did not have a happy ending, though.
Just before 9 a.m. the helicopter crew spotted a plane wreck in the woods at Petrovice near Měčín, which is roughly six kilometres away from the place the plane made its last call. "We found the plane and two bodies showing no signs of life," confirmed Korandová.
The crashed aircraft was partially stuck in tree branches, and some pieces had fallen to the ground nearby. "We will look into the cause of the crash in cooperation with specialized experts and the Air Accidents Investigation Institute's personnel," added Korandová.
Civilization on borrowed time
Recently, I remembered an excellent "oner-liner" from one of the brilliant short stories by Šimek and Grossmann, which has a scene set a cemetery. The line goes like this: "I pointed out to her that although she was doing a very good job of crying, she was crying at the wrong grave!" That made me realize that a good number of world politicians are currently behaving in a very similar manner, by engaging in a pointless fight against the climate change.
They act as though Planet Earth was ruled by humans. In reality, we are a mere speck on her surface which she could blow out with her colossal forces, just like a gust of wind blows out a candle flame. I assume hardly any of those politicians have watched acclaimed British and U.S. nature documentaries featuring the destructive abilities of our blue orb. After all, one of the large active volcanos "letting a big one out" would be all it would take for our advanced civilization to soil itself.
It is very likely that this will happen in the near future. According to leading volcanologists, a number of big volcanoes are "locked and loaded" (such as Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal for the eruption to happen rather sooner than later, if it's going to happen anyway – before billions of dollars are utterly wasted on measures to reduce the production of carbon dioxide. Together with dust and toxic volcano gases, any furious little volcano could release into the air at least a hundred times more carbon dioxide than the amount that has already been reduced to the detriment of Europeans.
It thus makes no sense to be reducing CO2 production forcibly. Furthermore, it has been scientifically proven that when there is a considerable amount of it in the air, plants create more biological matter and are more resistant to dry conditions. A potential increase in temperature is much better for the human population than, for instance, an abrupt return to the ice age.
When we also take into account that the impact of solar cycles on the planet's climate are not fully understood yet, we will arrive at one reasonable conclusion only: Let's work hard on keeping the Earth as clean as possible and adapt with as little cost as possible to the other changes we can't compare our strength with!
The Giant Mountains Museum renovation delayed by a year
The Giant Mountains National Park (GMNP) management has postponed the deadline for bidding in the second tender to renovate the Giant Mountains Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original date of the opening of envelopes was set for 20th September, said Radek Drahný, a spokesman for the National Park. The reason for moving the bid submission deadline is a lower budget, which went from 110 million down to 83 million Czech crowns.
"We are currently working with the prices on the market. Cuts have been made to the budget, and we are now waiting for someone to offer us a price we would like. If they give us a price we could accept, the renovation work can start as soon as practicable," said Drahný.
The renovation works on the museum will commence about a year later than originally planned. The GMNP was planning to have the building work supplier secured by the end of last year, and intended to start the construction work this spring. According to the top management of the National Park, the CZK 123 million of EU grants allocated to the project are not under threat.
So far, the GMNP management has not succeeded in selecting a construction company that would carry out the renovation of the museum. The second invitation to tender was issued in summer this year, as all bids submitted by companies in the first tender had greatly exceeded the price that had previously been estimated at CZK 65 million. The bids were over 100 million Czech crowns.
The museum, which is located in a former Augustinian monastery and comes under the GMNP management, has been closed since autumn 2017. The company that will eventually win the contract should supply the building work included in the project. The total costs, which include the installation of a new exhibition space, are estimated to be around CZK 210 million. When the exhibition rooms are swapped, the now cleared-out building is set to house the GMNP's visitor centre by the end of 2021.
The renovated museum, complete with a new interactive exhibition that would display the story of nature and mountain settlers, as well as to follow up from the ‘Rock and Life’ exhibition, should serve visitors as a ceremonial gate to the Giant Mountains. The visitor centre will provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most comprehensible way and motivate people to both discover and protect the mountains. It should also serve as a traditional museum. The centre will be available as a venue for concerts, festivals, theatre performances and lectures under the open sky. Building a new entrance into the building, a new research room and a café is also included in the plans.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, the second generation of the Mirai is coming
The Toyota Mirai was never going to stay just a concept. Toyota have been so serious about the vehicle that they included it in their offer even when there was practically no hydrogen fuelling infrastructure in place. Granted, the offer was not completely standard as customers had to specifically go for this vehicle, but no-one else was offering an option like this at the time.
Toyota's Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at the international conference on hydrogen that the new generation of the vehicle is coming next year. Toyota still believes that these cars are the future and within ten years their price will be comparable to that of hybrids. This naturally goes hand in hand with developing a network of fuelling stations. Still, the future lies in both hydrogen and electric power.
During the conference, the word hydrogen was often mentioned in connection with the need of environmentally friendly power source not for passenger cars but conversely for big trucks, ships, trains, etc. In short, those vehicles that need to overcome long distances after filling up the tank. This option is simply not available in the purely accumulator version. Toyota could then find new markets thanks to years of experience and long-term development.
We should also mention that Hyundai also believe in hydrogen power source in the same way Toyota does. Hyundai now has the Nexo hydrogen crossover on offer.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Pick the right tone of lipstick: there are many shades of red
When choosing red lipstick, you should determine first whether you are a warm or cool colour type. Try a simple test – look at the veinlets on your wrist. If they are bluish, you are a cool colour type. If they are greenish, you are a warm colour type. When picking a new red lipstick, make sure you realize, before anything else, which undertone category you are in. Only then should you consider the texture.
If you are one of those women who are in the cool undertone category, then violet, plum, cherry or mauve shade coloured lipstick will suit you most.
If you are in the warm colour skin category, go for a lipstick colour that is also warm. Those are the ones that are coloured in the tones of orange, coral, gold and brown.
You may as well be the type of woman who has veinlets of both colours, green and blue. In this case, you can congratulate yourself – you don't have to consider your undertone and can just concentrate on your own colour preferences.
A calculated smear campaign? Ústí and Labem Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, nobody wants the job
Most recently at end of this month. The city council leaders put it down to the rumours that have emerged around Václav Poživil, the former director of the Zoological Gardens and a veterinarian in one person. The rumours assert that he was intentionally killing exotic animals in his care. Some of the animals in question were the female rhinoceros Zamba, female elephant Kala and male orangutan Ňuňák.
The City Council has therefore called for new bids. "A contract for veterinary care in the Zoological Gardens at an estimated value of CZK 3.5 million without the VAT, and a contract for the city's Animals in Need Centre at an estimated value of CZK 2.8 million without the VAT," clarified Romana Macová, a city council spokeswoman.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (Ústí Citizens Forum) explained that this was the third time the city council had invited bids for a veterinary care contract. "Doctor Poživil had to explain the unfounded accusations. In my opinion, they are outrageous claims designed to defame a good-quality expert," she commented.
She says that there are only very few people who specialize in exotic animals. "This is definitely nothing pleasant. For the time being, the Zoological Gardens provide veterinary care by way of outsourcing," she stated. Both outsourcing and having a contract cost the same. "However, the Gardens must comply with the law on public procurement in the matters that concern financing," explained Nikola Roštejnská, a zoo spokeswoman.
Václav Poživil ranks among highly regarded specialists. He took part in, for instance, a unique operation, during which Ústí's female cheetah Jane received a total hip replacement, as the first cheetah in the world. He was the Director of the Zoo from 2009 to 2012. He has made no comment on the anonymous slurs about him. Yesterday, he wasn't accepting any phone calls nor responding to any text messages.
In the matter of the zoo contract, some veterinary surgeons are of the opinion that the potential lack of interest in taking up the job may not necessarily be down to fear of similar calculated accusations as is in his case, but simply due to low awareness. For instance, Jiří Král, a veterinarian in Ústí, has not heard of it until now. "The first time I've heard about it is now from you. Nobody has contacted us. Information about a matter like this usually travels around fast, I think," he added.
The D line to be overseen by a new architect for the metro, she brings in experience from the London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has chosen an architect who will oversee the visual aspect of the metropolitan metro. As of October, the job position will be filled by Anna Švarc. Her primary task is to design the visual look of the new D line, though she'll be in charge of the existing stations too. She believes that the metro should not be viewed as a transportation structure only; she thinks that travelling by underground should be an aesthetic experience, as well.
The Czech architect, who also worked on, for example, the renovation of three London Underground stations, was awarded the tender issued by the Prague Transport Company (PTC).
She submitted her tender alongside other 14 bidders. "Submitting a motivational letter and my CV was also part of the procedure. It was probably my previous work experience in London that was the deciding factor. In a team of three people, I worked on a sort of aesthetics manual for their tube," clarifies the new metro architect. She thinks that her work experience in the Prague Institute of Planning and Development could also have been a contributing factor in the decision.
She doesn't see the metro as a transportation structure serving one purpose only. Stations should have an aesthetic value too.
"I have some ideas about what can be changed in the metro and how to improve the space. But I will only be told by the transport company in the next few weeks what their procedure is and what ideas they have," says Švarc.
"These are recommendations, rather than a series of dogmas. The recommendations are there to mainly ensure that all stations are kept to a similar style in case they are ever refurbished," she interprets the design manual.
The question of whether a similar tool would be the right path for improving the public space in the Prague Metro remains to be answered. The Prague Metro is very specific. "I really can't tell right now whether the manual is the ideal, or whether a known personality would take it from here," concludes Švarc.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, the public can pay their respects on Sunday
The funeral of the former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will be held at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris on Monday evening, reported the French media referencing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public can say their last goodbyes to the former Head of State during a tribute ceremony at the Invalides Monument in Paris on Sunday afternoon, where Chirac's body will lie in state, Élysée Palace has announced.
According to the AFP news agency, crowds of people have been flowing into the President's residence since Thursday evening in order to sign a book of condolence. They can do so until Sunday. President Emmanuel Macron declared Monday a national day of mourning.
Meanwhile, more reactions to the death of the former Mayor of Paris and President, who served between 1995 and 2007, are coming from both France and abroad. Prime Minister Édouard Philippe described him as "a Frenchman in every sense of the word".
Chirac was also remembered by the Japanese, since the politician was known there for his love of their country and sumo. The news of the former French President's passing appeared on the front pages of all Japanese daily newspapers, including the sports papers, notes the French press.
The Museum of Tribal Arts in Quai Branly in Paris, founded by Chirac, will not be charging entrance fees for ten days, in honour of the former Head of State.
Late-ripening pumpkins hold up the opening of Pumpkin World
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkův Brod area) – Pumpkin World at a farm in Nová Ves u Leštiny in the Havlíčkův Brod area opens today and will stay open for visitors for over a month. Huge orange pyramids stand out among thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins arranged in decorative displays in the garden. The autumnal event, which has now become a tradition, starts a week later this year, because the pumpkins in the nearby seven hectares of field that belong to the Pipek family took longer to ripe. Many are still in the fields now, Jaroslava Pipková told the ČTK.
The Pipeks grow a range of pumpkin varieties; however, the weather hasn't been on their side in the past two years. This year's harvest was delayed, resulting in some varieties not doing so well. "We have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween as we always do, but some gourmet varieties didn't turn out well," said Pipková. In spite of that, there is an assortment of varieties to choose from at the farm; from the aforementioned large pumpkins that may also be used for scooping and ornamental carving, over culinary Hokkaido pumpkins and long "spaghetti-like" varieties, to decorative gourds of different shapes and colours.
Growing pumpkins is laborious work. Farmers hoe the plants and pick the fruits by hand, cutting the pumpkins off their stems with shears. The Pipeks have been opening their Pumpkin World to visitors regularly since 2010, attracting thousands of people over the years. The pumpkin decorations are complemented by straw attractions and log mazes. Visitors can also see farm animals which are kept there. The place will be open daily until 3rd November.
More details about the event are available on the farm's website, which also features the growers' recipes for pumpkin meals, including treats like muffins and pumpkin juice. More ways of cooking and preparing pumpkins are often shared by visitors themselves. "Many home cooks have their own tried-and-tested recipes, and we are happy to be inspired by them," said Pipková, adding that some housewives also pickle pumpkins in sour brine like gherkins.
Fixed luncheon contributions planned by the Ministry from 2021. There will be no changes in taxation
The Ministry of Finance is drafting an amendment to the Income Tax Act, which would see employees receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of all employees, who do not currently receive luncheon vouchers, i.e. about a million people, would then receive contributions towards their meals.
However, David Rýc, the Chairman of the Association of Voucher System Providers, says that many small businesses that do not have a canteen and do not provide luncheon vouchers cater for their employees either with food deliveries or deals with restaurants.
"The cornerstone of this proposal is that there will be no changes to tax benefits. Furthermore, the contributions will not be subject to the health and social insurance," said Schillerová on Friday, adding that the threshold for maximum contributions from employers, claimed as tax relief, would be kept.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay up to 55 per cent of the luncheon voucher value. The rest of the price is paid by employees. In some cases, employers choose to pay the rest of the value, but they can't claim tax relief on it. This year, the most advantageous value of a luncheon voucher for both employees and employers is 123 Czech crowns.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová have secured their qualification for the World Championship semi-finals MS
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec, as well as canoeist Tereza Fišerová have secured their qualification for the semi-finals at the Canoe Slalom World Championship in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš placed fourth in Friday's qualification rounds, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. Three other Czech national team members will attempt to secure their places in the semi-finals in the repechage qualifying run in Spain in the afternoon.
Vavřinec Hradilek, a member of our strong national kayak team, did not succeed. He received a 50-second penalty right at the start of the run for a wrong pass through a gate. By contrast, Přindiš and Prskavec can relax and concentrate on the semi-finals set to take place on Sunday.
"I had set myself a goal to place above thirtieth in the first run, which I managed to do. Not that I wouldn't care where I placed exactly, because we are starting very early on Sunday, so I had hoped that I'd finish a little higher to have a better starting point," said Přindiš praising the relaxed atmosphere in Seu. " Before the team race, I felt at the lowest point in the two weeks I've been here. Then during the race I felt good again, and it's even better today. The weather has been beautiful here the whole time, the race is nice, the spectators have turned up, so everything is alright," he smiled.
Prskavec was also happy with his result. "The most important thing in the qualifying rounds is not to make a needless mistake. I wasn't doing so well in the first gates. I negotiated the middle section very well, with no problems, and I knew I had covered quite a lot by then. Then I made my second mistake, when I wanted to go downstream straight and went backwards instead. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. I'm in good form, so we'll see how it goes," said this year's total winner of the World Cup.
Both national team members were glad they would start towards the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. "I'm not an early riser, and what's more, mornings are cold here. When you're supposed to be here at eight, you must wear a jacket and jumper," said Přindiš. "The whole semi-finals are an hour and a half long, which is a good contrast in terms of sleep," agreed Prskavec.
Fišerová was the only one to succeed out of the three single canoeists. Eva Říhová finished two places below the qualifying twentieth place, and Kateřina Havlíčková placed 35th. "I went down the upper course according to my plan, then I felt that I was a bit slower in the middle section and didn't follow my plan. But then I managed to get into a comfortable stream that I wanted to follow. I did two strokes and ended up just below the winner in terms of net time. I have a good starting point for the semi-finals," Fišerová relished.
Coal will give way to natural gas and nuclear power. Renewable resources do not meet the increased demand, says the Head of ExxonMobil Europe
Renewable resources in Czechia are not large enough to cover the future demand for energy. Due to the unfavourable climate here, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with alternative resources, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom said this in an interview for the HN. He is the President of the European branch of the U.S. ExxonMobil group, one of the largest global oil companies. He also mentioned that large repositories that could store power for later use, i.e. power not needed during the days when there is enough sunshine and wind, are still far too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil centre in Prague, where 1,200 people are employed. The centre is there to provide support for the company's business activities, and secure logistics and other services needed for the operation of the company.
Announcing the end of the right wing in the Chamber, or rather: What do you mean by a "right-wing" coalition of the ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Reports of an upcoming coalition of the above parties have recently been emerging in the media and from some commentators. Many are applauding the fact that "the right wingers" are finally getting their act together, but I would like to ask why these parties are still called right-wing.
Leaving the new Trikolora movement aside, there are in fact no real right-wing parties in the Czech Chamber of Deputies. It really does not matter what the individual entities call themselves, or what labels the mainstream media keeps regurgitating for them. The ODS, and its average top politicians, is in the centre only with difficulty. The TOP 09 is without doubt a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (but being ashamed of its left-wing politics it hypocritically calls itself a conservative, or even, right-wing party). The STAN is a party whose concept, ideology and voter targeting are pretty much identical to those of the TOP 09 (I simply don't understand why the party exists at all). And the KDU has even been labelling itself as centrist for some time now – although its political compass swings much more to the left than their members like to say.
Do you think that I am tarring them all with the same brush? Not at all. I based my opinion on the actual political steps taken by these parties. As I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, I value the freedom of an individual, a free market and minimal government intervention in the lives of individuals and the economy. To what extent do the said parties meet the requirements to classify as right-wing? How many acts of law that limit people's freedoms using salami tactics, increase taxes, approve new regulations and growing control, enhance ties to the socialist EU and support eco and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A large amount of them, really large. A party's identity is determined by its actions, not self-imposed labels. These parties seek to strengthen the role of the state in our lives via all kinds of declarations or partial concessions. This has nothing to do with right-wing politics.
I would not be surprised to see a working coalition of the TOP 09, STAN and KDU. They simply belong together on the political map. Ignoring the Christian, or reversely the pro-gay and gender aspects of the parties, I don't really see much of a difference in them in terms of their stance towards the impact of the state on their voters' lives. However, the ODS has been projecting itself for some time as "the only right-wing party". By associating itself with the other three entities, the ODS is now openly showing its true colours and the political bracket it is in.
By the way, having mentioned labels briefly, did you notice how often these parties are in full agreement and put cheap labels on critics of the dirigisme and socialism coming from the EU, and call those critics pro-Russian agents? These parties cannot, or simply do not want to, understand that there are many people who want to steer clear of Eurosocialism and increasing absence of freedom, as well as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Is it possible that these parties hide their total inability to make a valid argument, and their unfounded or blind adoration of EU ways?
In essence, it may be possible that politics other than centre politics does not have a chance of big success in the Czech Republic anymore. Maybe voters really want parties to group together. Maybe they want centre-left politics disguised as "right-wing", because they are ashamed of their political views (or are unable to identify them). I don't know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.
An unexplained death of a girl (†8) in the Příbram area: The perpetrator goes unpunished
Unsolved cases are referred to as "cold cases" in criminal investigation jargon. However, even those cases are re-opened if new information emerges years later. Especially, if it concerns the death of a child. In 1980, criminal investigator Jiří Markovič managed to solve a 12-year-old case of the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley. "A case dating back to 1955? That will be difficult, very difficult. To start off, the case file would have to be found, which may not even exist now, and we would need to speak to those who investigated the case back then. There is always hope, although it would be difficult indeed," says Markovič.
During the previous regime, not much information about violent crimes was released to the public. According to Markovič, however, this was by no means a sign of a lax attitude towards crime investigation. "It always depended on the individual people," the investigator thinks. What could pose a problem now is that the documentation dating back to the 1950s could have been destroyed in spite of the fact that unresolved cases should not be discarded.
Lucie Bílá's father never supported her dream. You won't believe what he wanted her to do for a living!
Those who don't know that the original profession of our national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is a seamstress and that her real name is Hana Zaňáková probably don't live in the Czech Republic. Now, the singer herself has revealed that she almost ended up working in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from quite a young age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when she, as a little girl, performed in the Cultural House in her native Otvovice, where the vocalist still lives today.
"I can remember exactly where Mum was sitting. The singer in me was born on that day," she disclosed to Impuls Radio.
However, her dad was a little worried about the future of his daughter, so he kept recommending her to choose a useful trade, which is a mine of gold.
"Dad always said: 'A trade, my girl, go for a trade. Keep your feet on the ground!' He was even trying to convince me to find a job in the local glass factory. The glass factory is not in business anymore, but I'm doing alright. I am a qualified seamstress and make all kinds of bead rosaries and trinkets at home, which I then sell at auctions. I use the money from the auction sales to buy wheelchairs," she added laughing.
The launch of a new tolling system is not under threat, announces Kremlík, though the change of the operator is at play
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport started preparing a new tender to award a contract to operate a new tolling system. This is a backup plan the government will put into place in the event that the current toll contract is legally terminated. In addition to that, the government is working on another interim solution to be used if the tender is not completed in time, the Transport Minister, Vladimír Kremlík (ANO), has posted on Facebook.
On Thursday, the Office for Competition Protection (OCP) issued a ban, deferred for a year, on fulfilling the toll contract between the government and the consortium of CzechToll and SkyToll. The Ministry is going to appeal the ban.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not under threat. As of today, we are starting to work on a new, transparent bidding procedure for a service contract to operate the new tolling system, currently finalised by the consortium of CzechToll and SkyToll," said the Minister.
The government's tender will seek a new operator of the tolling system that is currently being prepared and is due to be launched this December. Therefore, this is not a tender for a brand-new tolling system, as was the case in the last tender, nor utilizing the old system which is now operated by Kapsch.
According to Kremlík, the Ministry is also preparing for the possibility the new tender is not ready in time. "Based on the experience we have had in the tender process for a tolling system so far, I am absolutely sure that the OCP is misguided, as the 12-month period set out by them is objectively not enough for such a complicated bidding procedure to be prepared and completed, nor for the operation of the new tolling system to be handed over to a new operator," he said.
In addition to the new bidding procedure, the government department will also work on an interim solution, which would ensure toll collection over a temporary period until the government finds a fully-fledged solution.
At the moment, the government is therefore not likely to use the offer received in recent days from Kapsch, the current operator of the tolling system. The Austrian company had offered the government to run the existing system in case the toll contract is cancelled.
Kremlík also reiterated that he believed the backup plan would not be needed. The Ministry will thus appeal against the decision made by the antimonopoly authority.
The OCP issued a decision on Thursday, which banned the execution of the toll contract. However, the ban will come into force one year after the Office's decision becomes final and absolute by law. The decision itself is without prejudice and can be appealed against to the Chair of the Office. The Ministry and CzechToll therefore continue working on the new toll system, which is due to be launched in December.
In the tender held last year, the contract for a new tolling system and its operation was awarded to the consortium of CzechToll and SkyToll. The consortium won the tender for the tolling system with their bid of 10.75 billion Czech crowns for a 10-year operation. The current operator, Kapsch, which lost the tender with its bid exceeding 13 billion Czech crowns, contested the tender procedure and the validity of the toll contract.
I still feel like a boy who is just finding his feet, says Jan Cina
"All of us who worked on it learnt a lot. I fell in love with African dance during my time there. Because of my Romani heritage from my dad's side, I was completely enchanted by it," said Jan Cina, who sees himself more as a musical theatre actor.
The role of a decorator he plays in a new film, Národní třída, is much fresher in his memory than the První krok series. Cina has revealed that film director Štěpán Altrichter had to coax him a lot into taking the part. "It was hard work, but the result is worth it. The movie was made a year ago. Diligently and properly, but having fun at the same time. It was shot in National Avenue, where I drove a car despite not being a driver. We were also shooting a lot in Jižní město in Prague," he said about the Czech/German co-production feature film.
Despite having been nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in The Little Prince production, he doesn't consider himself at the pinnacle of his career. "I don't feel like I'm at the pinnacle. I still see myself as a boy who is just trying to find his feet. But the nomination was very pleasant and came as a surprise to me. I see the pinnacle far ahead of me," he said and revealed that he hadn't even thought about a thank-you speech in case he wins. "Not really, but when I was a child I always listened to discussion programmes on the radio and imagined myself talking to people like that."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague, Petr Vančura, for thirteen years now. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "Loving each other and seeing problems as a challenge and a good thing to be resolved," he divulged and cast his mind to the time his boyfriend fell off the stairs at the Czech Lion Awards ceremony.
"Yes, it really did happen. He had a new pair of slippery shoes, and the red carpet was slippery as well. So, it didn't take long for him to find himself on the floor. He managed to work it to his advantage. He ran a workshop called Vančura's Steps, where he taught how to safely fall off stairs at VIP events."
Děčín Zoo delighted at the birth of a baby macaque
"We have seven members in the troop at present. The youngest member was born on 17th August to a female called Buffy, as her fifth offspring. The father is a male macaque called Hitam. The first few days after giving birth, the mother carried her young closely to her body and wasn't keen on showing to the world whether it's a male or a female. When the young macaque was roughly three weeks old, she gradually started putting him down for short periods of time. Now, the keepers have known for a few days that it's a male," said Alena Houšková, a zoo spokeswoman, and added that 12 young of this species were successfully reared at the Děčín Zoo already.
The crested black macaque is a species that is endemic to Sulawesi Island, which means that it is not found in the wild anywhere else in the world. Its characteristic feature is its black fur and a spiked crest on the head, which the species is named after. Crested black macaques live in rainforests, predominantly at low altitudes.
Similarly to other primates, they eat both meat and plant-based food. Their diet largely consists of woody plant fruit, which they supplement with flowers and leaves. They get their protein from small arthropods, larvae and, to a smaller extent, young birds and bird eggs.
"Aside from their natural enemy, the python, humans are again to blame for everything else. The locals hunt macaques for their fur, and are seen by them as popular prey with tasty meat. What is also fatal for these animals is the burning and deforestation of rainforests," added the spokeswoman.
Germany reports the first case of West Nile fever infection transmitted by a mosquito within the country. There is a link to climate change
Mosquitoes may also pass on diseases other than West Nile fever, such as malaria.
On Friday, Germany reported its first case whereby a person has contracted West Nile fever after an infected mosquito bite within Germany, informed the DPA agency. Up until now, all patients have had the virus passed on during travelling abroad or by contact with infected animals. Experts say that the watershed case of infection is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute has announced that a 70-year-old man from Saxony contracted the virus. The course of the disease was severe in the man, who was hospitalized in Leipzig due to an inflammation of the brain. He is healthy now.
The West Nile fever virus was first discovered in Uganda in 1937. It then spread to large areas of Africa, Asia and Europe; and in the 1990s to the USA as well. The virus is carried predominantly by birds, and by mosquitoes that contract it from the birds' infected blood.
Managers of state-run companies are to undergo selection procedures now. The law will be possible to evade, claims the opposition
"This is a typical bill that is pointless," said Zbyněk Stanjura, the Chairman of the Civic Democratic Party parliamentary political group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Lower House passed amendments that should prevent a non-transparent allocation of posts – critics say cronyism – in state-run companies in the future. The applicants should newly undergo a selection process in the particular ministry and be assessed by a government committee for personal nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which parties like the Civic Democratic Party are not fond of, as it will supposedly allow ministers to shift the blame onto the selection committee for any potential wrong choices of state managers. Furthermore, the opinion of the said committee will not be binding for the minister. The new bill is to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: A driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died stuck in his Fabia
A tragic road accident occurred on a straight stretch of the road between Přerov and the village of Kokory on Friday. The 28-year-old Fabia driver lost control of his car and steered off the road. The car overturned leaving the driver stuck inside. He succumbed to the injuries sustained.
"Based on the initial information gathered on the site, a passenger car heading to Kokory steered off the road, where it turned onto its roof leaving the driver stuck underneath the car," said Miluše Zajícová, a Přerov Police spokeswoman, to the novinky.cz online newspaper.
So where are the spectators? Doha can't be London
It is a step back at the same time. By moving to Doha, athletics has voluntarily and knowingly given up the thrilling atmosphere present in the sold-out London stadium in 2017, as well as in the European Championship in Berlin last year.
Gigantic banners displayed on skyscraper walls in Doha invite us to the "biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified its backdrop will be are growing.
"All tickets for the seats behind the finish line are sold out for all evenings," claim the organizers.
That's not enough, though.
The top section of the 40,000-seater Khalifa Stadium is now covered with multicoloured sheets, which display the flags of 209 participating countries. By coming to Qatar, athletics has entered territory where it has no roots despite the annual Diamond League meetings.
Therefore, we can hardly be surprised that last week only 50,000 tickets in total were sold for the ten days of the championship in spite of their price starting at 60 Qatari riyal, which is just under 400 Czech crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves a target whereby they aim to fill up the uncovered parts of the stadium at least up to a half. The Guardian, a British daily newspaper, reports that the organizers are allegedly giving away tickets to migrant workers and children for free (though the organizers deny this claim). This is something Sebastian Coe, the President of the IAAF athletics association, is able to put a positive spin on: "This could be a way to inspire new-coming generations."
In the past, wealthy Qatar was awarded to hold the world championships in handball and cycling. After the athletics event, it will also host football in 2022. Financial offers from the oil superpower are always lucrative even for rich sport federations. Such is the reality of today's world of sport.
Even if we accept this reality and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, purely from the sport side of things we can't help but sigh over the fact that this experiment, i.e. the first outdoor World Athletics Championship in the Arabian Peninsula, should have been timed better by the leaders of the IAAF – and held in a different year. By holding the event so extremely late, which was necessitated by the climate, the entire schedule of the pre-Olympic year season has been disrupted. As a consequence of that, the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally begin for athletes in October, will be disrupted too.
Perhaps Qatar will at least compensate for this with technological innovations, which promise to bring us a state-of-the-art and attractive championship. Is it 37 degrees right now? Even now, the stadium area is being artificially air-conditioned down to 24 degrees. Advanced cameras, built in each starting block, will show close-ups of athletes during the few hundredths of a second before and just after the starting shot to television viewers too.
Sparta are really energetic this year, acknowledges Hradec defender Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Richard Nedomlel, Hradec's ice-hockey defenceman, will play in the Friday match against the club he played for not so long ago. However, the former Sparta player is sure that his team-mates are going to be just as spirited as he is, even though they have never worn the Prague club's jersey.
"Everybody wants to put on a great game when they're playing against Sparta," says the Hradec defenceman before the match of the 5th Extra League round.
Hradec Králové will try to extend their series of victories, which presently come to three three-point victories in a row. After Kladno and Pilsen, Sunday saw a victory that was most appreciated by fans. Mountfield went to neighbouring Pardubice to get it.
"We can't keep looking back at the past matches. We need to concentrate on the matches that are ahead of us now, and keep the same level of play, if not better," points out the Hradec defenceman.
The Hradec players should not keep looking back at last year's scores with Sparta either. They lost three out of four matches, and won points only once in extra time after a victory in Prague. In addition to this, Sparta's management put a few more great players on the team in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta have always had good-quality players, and let's face it, they are really full of energy this year," admits Nedomlel before the first match at the end of this week.
What about the second match? A hard slog as well; awaiting Mountfield in Třinec on Sunday afternoon.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden Bitcoins and does not know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is running internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. The bank is responding to the request of state-run Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which is seeking to send Bitcoin and Ethereum to the central bank. The bank could then pay the oil company's suppliers with cryptocurrencies. Their employees are also studying proposals that would allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies towards foreign exchange reserves, now near a three-decade low. Bloomberg has reported the above with reference to information acquired from four sources.
U.S. sanctions against President Nicholás Maduro's authoritarian regime have largely isolated Venezuela from the global financial system, exacerbating the country's economic crisis. The current crisis, which is one of the most severe crises in the world, has forced the officials to apply a medley of different methods to move money around. While Maduro's plans to start the world's first state cryptocurrency failed, the continued efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to come up with a way to evade the restrictions.
Neither Venezula's central bank nor PDVSA have replied to requests for comment.
It's unclear how PDVSA came to own Bitcoin and Ethereum, or what the value of its cryptocurrency holdings is. The company has struggled to get paid by customers via conventional channels because major banks are hesitant to do business with sanctioned entities. Last month, the company received most of a 700 million U.S. dollar payment (16.6 billion Czech crowns) in Chinese yuan, because the parties had struggled to find financial institutions which would facilitate the transaction.
PDVSA may be hesitant to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market as this would require the company to register with a stock exchange and subject itself to an in-depth check procedure called due diligence. Instead, it wants the central bank to use cryptocurrency for paying the entities that are owed by PDVSA. The oil company's officials believe that the central bank is less exposed to potential blocks which could emerge when paying with cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin and Ethereum use decentralized online ledgers, known as blockchain, to verify and record transactions. In some cases that allows for relatively anonymous transfers without the need for a middleman. Only few banks touch digital currencies because of money laundering issues and know-your-customer complexities that come with it, which make compliance with regulations more difficult.
After the debacle of 2018, cryptocurrencies are making a comeback this year, thanks to expectations of greater institutional adoption and Facebook's plan to launch its own cryptocurrency, but remain quite volatile. While Bitcoin has plummeted by almost 20 per cent in the last four days, it's still up around 130 per cent since the beginning of this year.
Neckermann cancelling all flights, five hundred Czech clients affected
Neckermann is cancelling flights due to Britain's Thomas Cook and its German subsidiary going to insolvency.
"Thomas Cook s.r.o., a Czech company trading as Neckermann Travel Agency, has not filed for insolvency," stated Šrámek in a press release.
"However, Neckermann Travel Agency is forced to cancel more planned departures of its clients," he said and added that all departures from 26th September to 6th October are currently affected.
According to Šrámek, cancelling the flights will impact on roughly 500 clients. He also says that the 800 Neckermann clients who are currently stranded abroad will be "taken care of, and their safe return to the Czech Republic will be provided by way of their scheduled flight".
The travel agency has admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their accommodation. "In cases like this, it is necessary for our clients to contact the Neckermann Travel Agency SOS line without delay," added Šrámek.
Thomas Cook collapsed on Monday. Nonetheless, in August the travel agency made a deal which would have seen its creditors put GBP 900 million into the company.
Half of the amount was supposed to be acquired from Fosun Tourism, a Chinese company that would have become a majority owner of the agency. The other half was supposed to be provided by bond holders and creditors' banks. However, as soon after as 20th September a piece of information emerged that the creditors had asked the travel agency to acquire a GBP 200 million reserve, otherwise the deal was off. On Monday, the company made an announcement that it went bankrupt.
A non-violent homeless woman killed under a bridge. The police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague Police, the murder occurred sometime between the early evening hours on Tuesday and early Wednesday morning. The police have issued an appeal for potential witnesses who may have seen something relevant during the specified period of time.
"Some of the drivers who were passing across the bridge between Libeň and Žižkov, or along Pod Krejcárkem Street, may have recorded the murderer on their dashcam, for instance. There may be witnesses who perhaps only saw the murderer and could give us his/her description. Basically, we welcome any witness evidence related to this case and will accept the information on the 158 emergency line," said Jan Daněk, a spokesman for the Regional Police Headquarters.
According to spokesman Daněk, the murdered homeless woman avoided conflicts, didn't drink alcohol and generally preferred her own company. She was murdered in her rough sleeping spot. "She was mostly moving around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, and used to carry large blue shopping bags with her," Daněk added the victim's description, which could help find potential witnesses.
Slovakia's appeal successful, they get away with a fine only for racist abuse
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded in their appeal against their stadium closure, a penalty imposed for racist chants by fans. The national team was originally set to play the European Championship qualifying match against Wales in an empty stadium without spectators. Instead, the Association is now required to pay only a 15-thousand-euro fine (approx. 387 thousand Czech crowns).
The UEFA disciplinary committee penalised Slovakia and Hungary for their fans' behaviour at their recent qualifying match against each other in Budapest. The visiting team led by Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. The committee decided that both associations will close their stadiums for one match, and Slovakia was required to pay a 20-thousand-euro fine, while Hungary a 67-thousand-euro fine.
After they appealed, the Slovaks are only required to pay 15 thousand euros for their abusive political chants. The nearest match between the national team and Wales in the European Championship qualifiers, played in Trnava on 10th October, will thus be open to the fans.
Basketball players fail to reach a medal position in the Under-17s World Championship, they placed fourth
The third Under-17s World Championship was won by the USA again, whose team closely defeated Spain 77-75, in spite of the 40 points achieved by one of the Spanish players, Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not get a copper medal, but maybe we were too desperate for it. We started off well, but didn't manage to keep the level, as they wiped the floor with us under the basket," captain Karolína Malečková said with regret. "Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience, though," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czech players had a strong start and were in the lead 8-0 thanks to two three-pointers. They dominated the court throughout the whole first quarter. During that time, it looked like they were going to repay their opponents the defeat 85-88 at the group stage in overtime. However, the referees signalled 15 fouls in a half-time, and their disputable decisions helped Hungary return to the game with a 12-2 streak.
"I'm sure that scoring two or three more times and gaining 20 points would have been enough for us to remain on top. Instead, we made mistakes. I don't care about the decisions made by the referees. I am more interested in what we did wrong. There were mistakes on our part, which helped the opposing team players seize their chance," coach Richard Fousek evaluated the match.
"This wasn't the first time we have had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters. They didn't ease off, and they kept fighting right to the end. The opposing team had very skilled players, though," he added.
It was mainly Petra Holešínská, with her accurate long distance shots, and pivot player Tereza Šípová who were the leading players in the Czech team. The best Czech scorer had problems with fouls, though, and was absent from the court for the most part of the third quarter. The Hungarian players used this to their advantage and gained a slight head start, which they held on to despite the Czechs fighting to the last seconds.
"The first five matches were very challenging for us. We kept turning the game in tight rotations, which cost us a lot of strength. By the time they played against Spain, it was apparent that the girls were tired and had no reserves to dip into. Because of the state of their fitness they were not thorough in their defence. Their counterattack wasn't fast, and there was no rebound. In addition, the Hungarian players are so good that if you fail to pull everything together, you can hardly win," added Fousek.
He believes that his charges have a promising future ahead of them. "In the past two years, the girls managed to win the Youth Olympic Games, place second in the Under-16s European Championship, and now they have won the fourth place in the World Championship. By our standards, this is a good-quality team with a good character. We need to work with them further and develop their talent. It is now up to the federation which coach they will allocate to them in higher categories," added Fousek.
End of political cronyism? Critics say the new law won't help anyway!
However, some opposition members of Parliament say that the law would be more likely to encourage Ministers to shift their responsibility in choosing the candidates and carry on selecting their own candidates.
A greater transparency during selection procedures for posts in state-run companies – this is one of the aims of the Nomination Act, voted for by 119 members of Parliament. The bill was approved mainly thanks to the ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even the Pirate Party.
Candidates applying for jobs in state-run companies will have to undergo a selection procedure run by a government committee. The Pirate Party was among those seeking to make the committee's recommendation binding for Ministers. However, this has not been included in the bill in the end.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement are concerned that the Nomination Act will play into the hands of the Ministers. "The Ministers will now be able to hide behind a decision reached by the committee without bearing the responsibility for clear transparency," thinks Tomio Okamura, the Chairman of the SPD. Martin Kupka, the Deputy Chairman of the ODS, talks in similar terms.
The government committee would completely reject those candidates who fail to meet the requirements, which include having a clean criminal record, no debts and a minimum age of 25. The main selection criterion should also be the candidates' level of expertise in the field.
The bill is set to go to the Senate for approval and then it must be signed by the President.
A heavy competition for the Škoda Kamiq. The Kia XCeed is banking on its wide range of features, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a model that is relatively hard to assign a category to. It is definitely a compact SUV; however, it does not have a four-wheel drive. This feature is left to its bigger sibling, the Sportage, which is a direct answer to cars like the Škoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X and Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to those, the XCeed is banking on its more dynamic shape of the bodywork, whose sloping rear may remotely resemble the world of the SUV Coupé, made popular in this part of the market with the premium brands, such as the Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed cannot be grouped together with the plastic-covered versions of classical compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. In contrast, the Koreans have made many more changes to the bodywork, so those who do not want to recognise it as the Ceed in a new shape, probably do not have to.
Unlike the compact hatchback or the Ceed Estate, the XCeed also exclusively offers forced-induction engines, so do not expect a basic, naturally aspirated 1.4-litre engine. The XCeed starts on a force-induction one-litre engine and also offers a force-induction 1.6-litre engine with 150 kW, the GT version reserved for its siblings. Do not expect to find a sports mode here. The Turbo Diesel 1.6 CRDi is only offered as a mild-hybrid, which means that the combustion engine is assisted by an electric power set, which helps reduce the fuel consumption and emissions. From 100 kW onwards, it is also possible, in addition to a manual transmission, to pay extra for a seven-gear, dual-clutch automatic transmission.
There will soon be a plug-in hybrid version as well, which will be able to go about 60 kilometres powered by electricity only. The batteries can also be charged in an ordinary plug socket.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bílá!
A day before the launch of her calendar titled Fuck the Age! Simona Krainová released her latest photographs in which she is fully naked. "I was a little afraid of people judging me for posing in nude at my age. You see, I am quite a shy person. But so far, I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that where there's a will, there's a way. You can have a toned figure even at the age of 46. Of course, it's hard work and sacrifice, but there is no way around it."
"Lukáš Dvořák took about three thousand pictures of me, then we selected about a hundred of them, twelve of which are in the calendar, so the rest will have to wait for their moment. This is definitely not the last time I've posed naked," the fashion model told the Blesk. She turned up to the launch event in a very revealing outfit, as well.
She wore a long blazer by Bernhardt with a pair of shorts underneath. The shorts were completely out of sight, so she appeared to have forgotten the bottom part of her outfit. With her legs toned thanks to her daily jogging routine, she gets away with wearing outfits like this.
Simona was so happy about the success that she kept kissing everyone she met at the launch. Her husband, friends, and even Slavík-Award winner Lucie Bílá.
Auto-Tune has brought the voice of a digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, claims the title of a lengthy piece written for the Huffington Post website by Michael Hobbes, with images by Finlay Mackay. His provocative caption underneath explains that for decades, the medical community has ignored the facts about obesity to wage a cruel (and futile) war on overweight people, which both scarred the public perception and ruined many lives. It is time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes outlines right at the beginning is the fact that often a long, exhausting journey lies between the knowing and understanding of facts and putting them into practice. In reference to this, he mentions scurvy, a disease some 17th-century sea captains believed could be prevented by consuming lemons, limes and oranges, so they distributed them among their crew. However, the British Navy, wary of the expanding cost, stopped this practice. The effects of fruit on the prevention and treatment of the disease was clearly proved in the mid-18th century, though it wasn't until a further fifty years that the Navy took the information on board. Seat belts existed long before the automobile was invented but weren't mandatory in cars until the 1960s. Similarly, the first confirmed death from asbestos exposure was recorded in 1906, but it was not banned until 1973.
"Every discovery in public health – no matter how significant – had to compete with the traditions, assumptions and financial incentives of the society implementing it," Hobbes writes. In U.S. society, nearly 80 per cent of the adult population and about one third of children now meet the definition of overweight or obese. More Americans live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV put together.
Still, obesity is viewed as a distinctly personal failing of individuals, who are told that they are putting a strain on the health care system and shrinking the GDP. The fear of becoming fat is so great among the population that it drives Americans to spend more on dieting than they spend on video games and movies. The truth is, though, that diets do not work. Since 1959, research has shown that 95 to 98 per cent of attempts to lose weight fail, and two thirds of dieters gain back more than they lost.
Armed with statistical data, Hobbes goes on describing the lifestyle and trauma of overweight people. The personal meets the systematic here – for instance, future doctors at medical schools receive an average of just 19 hours of nutrition education over the whole period of study. This is happening while 60 per cent of the calories Americans consume come from ultra-processed food, i.e. foods which have undergone significant food processing.
The obesity stigma can be seen in doctor's surgeries, where overweight people are usually given shorter appointments, doctors show less empathy for them and see them as more problematic patients.
However, excess weight gain is not just an American problem by a long shot. Hobbes writes that since 1980, the obesity rate has doubled in 73 countries and increased in 113 others across the world. And in all that time, no country has reduced its obesity rate, or stop it from growing. Not one.
Brno Grand Prix? Ticket price rise threat
The most expensive item to be paid before the Grand Prix is the annual listing fee. This year, the fee was around 115 million Czech crowns. "Masses of people who come to Brno to see the Grand Prix spend money here for their accommodation, food and leisure activities, which should more or less balance out the cost associated with the organization of the event, including the listing fee," economist Petr Pelc evaluated the situation.
He says that holding the race is also beneficial in that it brings tourists into the city. "There aren't that many world tourist attractions in Brno. The Grand Prix pulls in visitors from abroad as well. The race is as much important for Brno as Tuřany Airport or the exhibition centre, for example. And those projects are funded from public money," added the economist.
Brno Grand Prix
– the costs in the past five years: CZK 686 million
– the profits in the past five years: CZK 682 million
– problems: insufficient funds for the organization of the event, rising cost of the listing fee charged by the promoter, Dorna
– possible solutions: more funding from the government, utilizing some spaces for advertising, increasing ticket prices
– current situation: talks in progress over a new five-year contract to hold the race
According to the Head of the Public Administration Institute, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now assess whether the race brings benefits to Brno. "The Grand Prix draws money from public funds for other purposes. To some extent, this is a political issue, not an economic one," he thinks.
The cost associated with the motoring event may be even higher in the future. There is a possibility that the listing fee will go up to almost a double of what it's now.
"The situation hasn't been resolved yet. We must try to come to an agreement with Dorna on the best possible conditions. It also depends on how much the government is willing to contribute towards the organization of the race. If it came to any of the worst-case scenarios, I'm afraid it is not realistic for the City and Region councils to pay the balance," admits Markéta Vaňková, the Mayor of Brno.
As reported by the Rovnost daily newspaper, the local government representatives of South Moravia Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising to tackle the problem of acquiring money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna imposes a condition that all advertisements must be located in places which are not visible in the shots of cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because in the case that Dorna already has a general sponsor, another company from the same industry can't become a sponsor," explained Vaňková.
The organizers can also gain more money from entrance tickets in the years to come. "We have to sit down and talk about how much the cost would actually come to. With this in mind, we must adjust the reprising of the tickets accordingly," said Petr Vokřál, Brno's opposition representative for the ANO movement and former Mayor.
A road accident on the D5: A motorway closed after a collision of lorries
The incident was reported around 8 a.m. and was based at kilometre 22 Prague-bound. "The motorway has been closed off – for freight traffic, to be more specific. Passenger cars can go via a petrol station," said Michaela Richterová, a police spokeswoman, in the morning. The road was re-opened for traffic at around 2.30 p.m. According to Richterová, the cost of the damage is estimated to be at least two million Czech crowns. The police are now investigating the cause of the accident.
The spokesman of the Central Bohemia Fire Brigade, Petr Svoboda, said that one of the lorries carried passenger cars, while the other was transporting plastic granules. "Due to the severity of the impact, the carried vehicles moved out of their place, so the firefighters had to secure them first to prevent any potential slides," he added.
The fuel tank in one of the lorries was ruptured causing about 200 litres of diesel to spill. The firefighters managed to pump out further 200 litres. Because the incident involved fuel spillage, officers of the Department for Environment at Beroun Town Hall were called to the scene. The clearing of the crashed vehicles and unblocking the motorway was secured by a private company, which also extracted the contaminated soil.
Czech athletes fail to qualify. No success in Doha so far
The World Championship in Doha started with setbacks in qualification rounds for Czech athletes. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out of the 800-metre heats. Neither pole vaulter Romana Maláčová nor hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková managed to qualify. Šafránková was set to defend her 8th place which she surprised us with in London last year.
Hurdler Vít Müller is taking part in the heats on Friday, and Marcela Joglová is set to run the night-time marathon.
Šafránková produced a throw of 65.46 metres with her third attempt and was nearly six metres behind her personal best this year, which she would have to improve in order to advance to the next round. Maláčová jumped 435 cm; however, the height of 450 cm was above her abilities. To take part in the finals she would have to go over 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who received her Championship invitation from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in the last minute, finished next to the last, at sixth place, in the fourth heats. Her time of 2:03.48 minutes proved not to be enough for her to advance to the semi-finals. She was behind her personal best this year by one and a half second. "It was quite fast for me. Unfortunately, I jostled with one of the competitors around the bend, which made me lose some of my strength. I thought I still had enough strength, but I was slowed down there. I almost stopped running and had to start again, so in this aspect, it was a bit unpleasant. I can't say I'm entirely happy," said the Czech national team member.
She was glad that she overtook at least one competitor in the home straight. "She wasn't doing very well at all, so every defeated competitor counts. But I think I finished fifth deservedly. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest middle-distance runner in the heats was Winnie Nanyondo from Uganda with her time of 2:00.36.
The best 800-metre runner of recent years, Caster Semenya of South Africa, will miss Doha this year. The levels of testosterone in her body are too high, but just as some other female runners, she refuses treatments, which are newly required by the IAAF rules this year.
In the 100-metre heats, American Christian Coleman confirmed his place of favourite number one. With his time of 9.98 seconds he was the only one to get under the limit of ten seconds. His compatriot, Justin Gatlin, has also advanced to the semi-finals, who at the age of 37 wants to defend his title. Nigeria's Divine Oduduru, who with his time of 9.86 seconds is number two in this year's tables, was not in the line-up. He expected to compete with Coleman, who managed a time of 9.81 this season.
Cuba's Juan Miguel Echevarría was in great form as early as in the long jump qualifying round. He managed to jump 840 cm at his first attempt. No athlete has managed to jump this far in the World Championship qualifying rounds in the past 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban is leading this year's tables with his performance of 865 cm.
Oscar-nominated French film Les Miserables is to open the Be2Can Festival
The 6th Film Festival which presents movies from Berlin, Venice and Cannes will feature the Golden Bear, both winners of the best actor category at this year's Berlinale, best director and jury awards at Cannes and much more. This year again, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the best of the most outstanding and thought-provoking films featured in competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
This year's festival will open with the French drama Les Miserables, for which Ladj Ly was awarded a Jury Prize in Cannes Film Festival this year. This French motion picture has been nominated for an Oscar. The preview of the film will be held in Prague, and the two main protagonists playing crime unit police officers, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga, will attend in person to introduce the film. Alexis Manenti is also one of the co-writers of the screenplay.
This year's Be2Can will take place in Prague's cinemas Lucerna and Edison Filmhub, and in Brno (the Art Cinema), Ostrava (the Minikino Cinema) and in Zlín (the Golden Apple Cinema) between 2nd and 8th October.
After the success in Cannes, Ladj Ly's directorial debut feature was presented and awarded at a number of other international festivals. The film won in the best film and best screenplay categories at the Durban International Film Festival. It was also presented at the International Film Festivals in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo, and will soon feature in San Sebastian.
Throughout the Festival, the audiences can also look forward to other films, such as Synonyms; Young Ahmed; System Crasher; So Long, My Son; Sorry, We Missed You; Ghost Town Anthology and The Golden Glove. In addition to this, they can also look forward to other brand-new movies from this year's Venice festival which will go into the Czech film distribution: the sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, and the Czech triumph The Painted Bird.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
A vote taken in the Upper House of the Canadian Parliament has confirmed the news that has been going around for a few days: Canada is revoking the honorary citizenship awarded to the one-time human rights activist legend and the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years in house arrest for her efforts to bring freedom to her country, was stripped of the honorary title for her role in the genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority group.
The House of Commons voted to revoke Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship last week, and the Senate has now unanimously supported the decision. "It is an appropriate message to send her, Myanmar and to the whole world," Independent Senator Ratna Omdivar commented on her colleagues' decision. "We need to send a strong signal that if you are an accomplice of a genocide, you are not welcome here in Canada – certainly not as an honorary citizen."
The Canadian Parliament's decision does not make a tangible difference to Suu Kyi, as it is just an honorary title, but it sends a strong symbolic message to her. It is unacceptable for the activist, who fought for human rights for many years, to remain silent while the army of mostly Buddhist Myanmar spent long months committing atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim minority.
A recent UN report put out that an officially organized genocide was being committed in Myanmar, and Suu Kyi – the de facto Prime Minister of the government – completely failed in her duty to protect her own citizens. The report specified the names of several military commanders who should, according to the team of investigators, be tried in court for crimes against humanity committed in action, which the report describes as "shocking for both their horrifying nature and ubiquity". The UN said that Suu Kyi and her administration was complicit mainly in that she covered for the actions committed by the soldiers, and that she spread a fog of lies to protect them – such as that the actions were "antiterrorist operations".
With Suu Kyi struck off, there remain five honorary Canadian citizens on the list: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, the 49th Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims Karim Aga Khan IV, and Malala Yousafzai.
The Canadian Museum of Human Rights reflected the developments around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy by including information about the atrocities committed against the Rohingya to the signage of Suu Kyi and about the Parliament's decision to strip her off the honorary citizen title. "We have also dimmed the light behind her image on our Human Rights Timeline and are planning to replace her image with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," the Canadian media quoted Rorie McLeod, the museum's spokesman.
The only thing Suu Kyi will retain amid the current upheavals – at least for now – is the Nobel Peace Prize that she won for her great contribution towards the fight for freedom in 1991, based on the nomination by Václav Havel. "While the current actions of Ms Suu Kyi are regrettable, her prize will not be withdrawn," said Lars Heikensten, the Head of the Nobel Foundation, to Canada's CBS.
Microplastics found in human stools, a study confirms for the first time
The study confirms what researchers have long suspected. A team of researchers led by Philipp Schwabl, a professor at the University of Vienna, published a study that has proved for the first time the presence of microplastics in human stools. Even though this was a small study – eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia – all of the stool samples were found to contain microplastic particles of sizes ranging from 50 to 500 micrometres. None of the subjects were vegetarians, and six of the group ate sea fish. All of them consumed food wrapped in plastic and drank water from plastic bottles.
It would actually be a small miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics, which are either created directly for use in, for example, the cosmetic industry, or emerge by the breaking down of larger pieces of plastic, are present in sea animals, insects, tap water and soft drinks; basically all around the planet. It was thus officially confirmed that they do enter the human digestive system. On average, 20 particles of microplastics were found in each ten grams of stools. Researchers estimate that more than half of the world population might have microplastics inside their bodies.
Both the non-expert public and experts naturally suspect that this is not good. However, humans are still not sure how great the harm is – and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles are capable of entering the bloodstream, the lymphatic system, and may even reach the liver. "This is the first study of its kind and confirms what we have long suspected. Now that we have the first evidence for microplastics inside humans, we need further research to understand what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.
What we know so far is that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the digestive system's immune response, and in doing so, aid the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogen into the body. Presently, we don't have any solution other than to reduce plastic use, especially polypropylene. This may prove to be difficult, though. First of all, the governments and authorities should at least put an end to the sharp increase of its use. Experts estimate that the number of plastic bottles alone will rise by a fifth in three years' time from today. Currently, a staggering million bottles are bought every minute. Roughly eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. Plastic waste is a threat to marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already adopted restrictions and other measures. For instance, Kenya introduced a ban on plastic bags under draconian penalties. The European Commission is introducing minor bans (the well-known straws), and our Ministry of the Environment follows in the same direction. However, critics say that, albeit nice, these measures are completely insufficient.
Harry retraces Princess Diana's footsteps (†36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in her ability to capture people's hearts. She created a stir in January 1997 when she visited Africa, a minefield site in particular. The images of her wearing a protective body armour and visor have become iconic. Back then, nobody could know that a few months later the Princess of Hearts would take her last breath following a tragic car accident in Paris.
Her younger son Harry made the same gesture when he went to the same site she visited 22 years ago. He went to the mine clearance site at Dirico, Angola, and he too donned a special protective body armour while being deep in thought. He surely couldn't help thinking back to his beloved mum, whom he lost when he was only 13 years of age.
Harry gave a speech directly on the site, in which he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, an organization that clears landmines and other explosives in countries affected by war. "Minefields are an unhealed scar of war. By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity," he said and made an appeal to protect and maintain the wildlife and keep the local river as a water source. After the visit, the Duke of Sussex went to Huambo to rename the local orthopaedic centre in honour of his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention her on his official Instagram account either: "The Duke is honoured to be visiting a place and a community that were so special to his mother, to recognize her tireless mission as an advocate for all those she (Diana) felt needed her voice the most, even if the issue was not universally popular," read the Sussex Royal Instagram post.
However, royal fans may have been disappointed at Harry not taking his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) along on this expedition to bring back memories of Diana. They both have had a separate programme from Harry's since Wednesday, presumably to ensure their safety. Granted, taking a small baby to a minefield doesn't sound too safe, and Harry doesn't want to put his beloved family in harm's way under any circumstances.
Only children. Our procreation is uncertain, but there is no need to scaremonger
Some words have a negative connotation about them, despite being just a term of description. One of those terms is "an only child". It denotes a child who grows up without siblings; however, the term doesn't sound neutral. "You know, an only child," people say and feel no need to add anything. What's interesting is the fact that "an only child" has been carrying this trait for a long time, even when terms like demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even those who are outside the scientific community know that in order to ensure just the replacement of the population, it is necessary to have a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman. It is also widely known that no country in Europe currently reaches this rate. The closest to this figure are France and Sweden. European countries do not have their net reproduction rate of the population secured. (The only exception in the West is Israel, where the total fertility rate is 3.1 children per woman.) This situation invites alarmism. It is therefore no surprise that even Maláčová, the Minister for Work and Social Affairs, submits to alarmism: "There are almost as many only children as there are two-child families," she said in an interview for the LN. But she'd forgotten that the devil is in the detail.
Yes, it is good that the issue is receiving attention and is not played down or ideologized, like it is, for example, in Germany where campaigns for more children are easily labelled as fascist (as in "Hitler was encouraging it, too"). It is good to be reminded that many couples plan outright to have one child only. It is good when politicians show their will to remove the obstacles that lead to such decisions (for example, the option to work from home is not widely available and this discourages women from wanting more than one pregnancy). Despite all this, let's highlight one issue here.
When Minister Maláčová says that there are "almost as many only children", a drop of demagoguery is present in this claim. This statement would have been befitting twenty years ago. Let's remind ourselves that the last time the fertility rate in the Czech Republic was reaching the population replacement levels was in 1980 ("Husák's children"). It was then declining, and in 2000 it dropped to a harrowing 1.14. However, since then it has increased by almost fifty per cent, up to the current rate of 1.70 children per woman, which is above average in Europe. As it is not at the population replacement level quite yet, the efforts by politicians are welcome. They should just take a notch down from the alarmism.
Costa Rica named a champion for fighting the climate change
Costa Rica was awarded the title for several reasons. First and foremost, for its plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 – a goal many countries have pledged to achieve as well in line with the Paris Agreement. The Central American country of around five million people produces only 0.4 per cent of global emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged that, by 2030, it will use solely renewable resources for its energy generation and expects 70 per cent of all buses and taxis to be electric.
The official tourist authority states that roughly 95 per cent of its energy already come from renewable resources – in 2017 Costa Rica ran for 300 days solely on renewable power.
Costa Rica boasts nearly thirty national parks.
The density of forests also helps reduce emissions. Covering over a half of the country, rain forests with their diverse fauna and flora are one of the country's main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the protection of nature and sets an example for other countries in the region, as well as the world. Climate change demands urgent action from all of us," a UN statement said.
Costa Rica boasts nearly thirty national parks, which is a really large number considering the small area of the country (51,100 square kilometres). Rain and cloud forests, coral reefs and mangrove swamps are home to five per cent of the world's diversity. There are also volcanoes and picturesque waterfalls in the country, where you'd also find a few sloth sanctuaries.
Planet-friendly. Researchers' Night is due to start in Prague
"In Prague, I would certainly visit the Czech Technical University to see the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is not normally open to the public," advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, the national coordinator of Researchers' Night.
In the Institute of Anatomy, you can join a tour of the autopsy room and try your hand at working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to the Czech University of Life Sciences and watch the film called Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will also provide tours with commentary. The motto of this year's Researchers' Night is "planet-friendly".
The Prosecutor General has reopened the prosecution of a mother who manipulated her daughter against the father
Prosecutor General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the dismissal of charges against the mother who was manipulating her daughter over a long period of time and disrupted the girl's relationship with her own father. The mother faced charges of child abuse and putting a child's development at risk. The Regional Court dismissed the charges against the mother; however, Zeman does not agree with the decision. He states in his appeal to the Supreme Court that a similar conduct may be seen as a criminal offence.
The decision made by the Supreme Court could have a broader impact on other cases as well. "A more specific definition of the particular form of abuse may be needed in order to give guidance when applying the law into practice," states Zeman in the appeal.
The District Court in Svitavy initially found the woman guilty of abuse of a person in her care and putting a child's development at risk. The mother had formed a firm, almost symbiotic, bond with her daughter, present even in situations the girl was supposed to be in her father's custody.
This resulted in the girl's pathological fixation on her mother and a strongly negative relationship towards her father. This situation affected the emotional development of the daughter, who was even put in hospital due to threats to harm herself in case she is put in her father's care.
The Court in Svitavy sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice department of the Regional Court cleared the woman of charges in appeal proceedings ruling that the actions do not constitute a crime. The same verdict was issued by the Regional Court after it was ordered by the Supreme Court to make a new decision.
The Regional Court stated that the situation in which one parent manipulates a child against the other are by no means exceptional. They are dealt with in guardianship proceedings, alternatively with the help of psychologists or youth social care authorities. Criminal law is only applied in exceptional cases.
However, according to the Prosecutor General the woman committed offences of both child abuse and putting a child's development at risk. "The defendant was fully intentionally arousing negative feelings in her daughter against her father, and has wilfully solidified these negative emotions in her. By doing so, she was pursuing an illegitimate intention to reduce or eliminate the minor's contact with her father, while being certainly aware that this would negatively impact the minor in the psychosocial sphere," states the appeal.
Zeman has asked the Supreme Court to refer the case to the Regional Court once more. It is evident from the appeal that the child is now in her father's care.
Step down, Czernin asks Schillerová due to her words about ‘opposition scum’
"I find it absolutely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government would use such totalitarian expressions anywhere, especially on the premises of the Parliament," wrote Czernin in an open letter to Schillerová.
Her words caused a stir during a debate on a proposal of a constitutional action against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition hadn't managed to gain enough votes, so the constitutional action proposal, which had been initiated by the Senate, was swept off the table by the Members of Parliament.
"Every day, I receive dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single voice that would support this action. These messages express support for the President. Other messages go along the lines of what the tax payers' money is spent on here and how we are flogging a dead horse. And I'd even take the liberty and quote one of these messages here, though I don't usually say rude words: They are opposition and senatorial scum," said the Minister of Finance.
"Such terms were used by the Nazis who often used these terms to refer to people of Jewish origin, and by the Communists who often referred like this to their political opponents. This rhetoric is totalitarian and does not have a shred of respect towards a person and an opinion," wrote Czernin to the Minister. Czernin is the Deputy Chair of TOP 09, who will compete with Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the current first Deputy Chair, for the post of the Chair of the party in autumn.
"I was quoting one of the dozens of messages I'd received throughout the debate in the Chamber of Deputies. Their common denominator is disgust over the continuous personal disparagement that we witness in this country's politics daily, and which was also the main topic of the debate in the Chamber on Thursday. I find it surprising that somebody would take this expression personally," responded Schillerová for the ČTK.
Destroyed shops, fire on streets, a memorial march accompanied by unrest
Five years ago, 43 students from a university in Ayotzinapa vanished. Despite extensive investigation the case remains unsolved. The students were allegedly detained by the police in the state of Guerrero, Mexico. It is not exactly clear what happened after that. According to the investigation, the students were in all likelihood handed over to the local crime syndicate, and then killed and burned, the APTN agency reports.
A memorial march was held in Mexico City on Thursday. The families wished to express frustration over the lack of answers and clarity about how their children had disappeared.
The mostly peaceful procession was marred by small groups of vandals who were destroying everything along the way. The vandals damaged shops and hotels, had no scruples about damaging historic landmarks, set fires in the city and broke windows.
President Andres Manuel López Obrador said before the march that he would do everything to hunt the criminals down, and asked the public to provide any information that could lead to solving the case.
Over 142 people were detained in the investigation, but none of them were convicted. Many had to be freed because their human rights had been violated. The investigators allegedly tortured the suspects, adds APTN.
Mahulena Bočanová broke her annual detox and is naughty again!
Mahulena Bočanová revealed to the Blesk over a year ago that she had quit drinking alcohol. "I said to myself during the holidays that I'd let my aged, worn-out, 50-year-old body catch a breath. My intention was to stop for good. I feel well-rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my mental health has improved. My mental health wasn't very good not long ago. Now I get up more easily and headache-free in the mornings, and I have more energy, as well as more money."
She says that one year of abstinence was enough for her. The actress has now found her way to enjoy alcohol again. "Occasionally, I'd have some bubbly or good-quality wine, but I don't drink as much as I used to. I would drink one glass and have a great time until the small hours. A bottle of wine stays in my fridge for a week or so. I've also come to like non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink any time I want," shows off Mahulena, who is still together with Petr, an entrepreneur from Brno.
Bočanová also returned at the end of the holidays when the theatrical season started and will newly appear in the Rose Garden Medical Centre series. "I feel ashamed for my first two performances. I was really bad – I kept stumbling over my words. But it's getting better now," the actress smiles critically.
Jaromír Soukup talks about Gott: He wishes him, first and foremost, peace and quiet
TV presenter and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) doesn't duck any issue. He publicly comments on various topics in his ‘Call and Write to the Boss’ TV programme. He does not shy away from tabloid current affairs either and discusses them with humour and a sharp-edged wit. However, this time he didn't feel like fun and games.
Jaromír Soukup talked about the sad news of Karel Gott falling seriously ill. Soukup has taken a personal pledge to do his bit to show consideration for the singer.
"You see, Karel has fallen ill. He has been open about it to prevent tabloid journalists from trying to dig out the information from odd sources. I don't want to comment on this, as it is a serious illness, and we all have an immense regard for Karel. I naturally wish his treatment is a success and, above all, I wish for him to have some peace and quiet! Something he needs to have right now," said the Barrandov Television owner.
"I would like the media to leave him alone. The media should wait for the information to be publicised by the Maestro himself when he wants to. I am not really fond of all the different statements given by his old acquaintances and various celebrities in which they tell us what they think about his current state of health. I can say, on behalf of our media, that we will talk about him and his illness when, and only when, he personally expresses his interest in us doing so. In my opinion, other media should consider a similar approach."
Young Czechs consider themselves good with money. The survey has not confirmed this
"It has shown that young Czechs think their own knowledge of financial matters is greater than it actually is. A significantly greater proportion of incorrect answers was given by women and respondents who have not taken their secondary school final exams," said Jaroslava Palendalová, the CEO of KRUK.
It's mostly men and young secondary school and university graduates who trust their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn about financial matters predominantly from their parents (37 per cent) and then self-education on the internet (23 per cent). Learning about it at school only ranked as number three (21 per cent).
Women are most likely to consult any issues concerning finances with their parents, whereas men tend to search for this kind of information on the internet. Acquiring information about financial matters from one's parents prevails in all age groups of young people, regardless of the level of achieved education or personal income. Leaflets from financial institutions, professional magazines and publications have very little or practically no effect.
"It has been shown, time and again, how important it is for children to be taught about this by their parents because they are regarded as an authority in all principal areas of their children's lives. That's why the level of financial literacy of parents is key as they pass their knowledge and experience onto their offspring," said Palendalová.
Saving money and making investments are preferred by 94 per cent of young people.
Young people are quite clear about the issue of whether it is better to save money and buy their own house or flat, or whether it is better to enjoy themselves and rather spend their money, without making savings and becoming homeowners.
The strategy of saving money and investing it in long-term tangible assets was supported by 94 per cent of the respondents. This was the case across all age groups of young people, regardless of the level of achieved education, social status or current level of their personal income.
The strategy of making savings was supported by 100 per cent of married people who have two or more children and by public sector employees. Conversely, people who live alone and have an income of over 30 thousand Czech crowns a month are more likely to prefer spending their money.
A gamekeeper hurt in a fall from a high seat, he was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred in an upland region near Čertův mlýn before 7.30 p.m.
"The terrain there is very rough and hard to go through, so five of our rescue workers had to be sent with appropriate technical equipment to the injured man. Simultaneously, we asked the Moravia-Silesia Emergency Medical Service for assistance. The paramedics then sent an ambulance to the site," Libor Kluz, the Beskids Mountain Rescue controller, described the circumstances around the rescue action.
The rescue workers found the gamekeeper, who had suffered multiple injuries, at the reported location. They immediately tended to his injuries and then carefully, albeit with difficulties, transported him down the trackless terrain on a wheeled stretcher.
"The journey down, which was about one and a half kilometre long, was slow and difficult. The wounded huntsman was thus handed over to the ambulance crew only about three hours later," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the accredited chief of the Beskids Mountain Rescue and a responding rescuer in one person, the gamekeeper's colleague was luckily able to describe in detail the injured man's whereabouts.
"That's why we found him relatively quickly. However, if he had the Záchranka application in his phone, our rescue workers would have got to him even sooner, and concurrently, the 155 emergency line call handlers would have been alerted about the accident and the man's situation instantly," pointed out Radan Jaškovský.
He added that in the mountains today, having a charged mobile phone with the activated Záchranka application should be a norm.
Zeman the preservationist – the man who stretches the Constitution calls upon enforcing the law
If you move in a society that is divided into camps and don't want to go completely insane, you may welcome situations when you don't need to cheer your own side for once. Sometimes, you may want to grant some plus points to those who you normally criticize. If not for anything else, at least for the feeling that you don't always act according to your pre-set label. One of these could be a situation when President Zeman goes on his beloved trips across the Regions and flaps about a list of seriously damaged heritage sites.
Everybody knows what the issue is. Those who travel around Czechia every now and then can see with their own eyes many of these dilapidated landmarks – from historic town centres to individual castles, monasteries, old houses and homesteads. Everyone senses that demagoguery could take the floor here. When we criticize the town council for their lack of action in heritage conservation or for eyesores in their zoning plans, it may as well be the legacy left from previous administrations. Or a building could have been privatized, and its owner can't be traced. The Head of State is now calling upon the local politicians: "A clause in the National Heritage Act allows you to fine those building owners who fail to look after their property." It should be recognized that the President is asking to enforce the law when the owner is unavailable, which is something even the critics of his bending of the Constitution should give him some credit for.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and technicalities of this complex problem. He can nevertheless see some silver lining in this, similarly to squatters who he disapproves of. We wrote two years ago: "Despite all the verbal abuse, the squatters are drawing attention to an issue no-one is currently interested in, i.e. this or that building is in a state of emergency." Let's admit that the President is de facto doing the same thing.
If you ever visit the historic centre of Jáchymov, you'll be staggered at how dilapidated it is – houses with original features from the Renaissance included. At this time, when Jáchymov celebrates 500 years since its silver mining and thaler (that's dollars for Americans) minting era. Why? Local officials say this is due to the hurried house sales of the 1990s. Why is it though that seven kilometres away from here is Ostrov, the former seat of the Schliks who used to mint Jáchymov thalers, whose historic town centre has been nicely renovated? It's just as well that the President draws attention to issues like this.
Babiš calls for security cooperation at the Victims of Terrorism Memorial
On 27th September 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the memorial to the victims of terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 at Ground Zero, New York.
Terrorism is the main enemy that all countries around the globe should fight jointly, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said today at the memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York. This marked the end of his five-day visit to the United States. The Prime Minister took this occasion to pay homage to two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very moving place," said the Prime Minister when he, accompanied by his wife Monika, laid a white rose at the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 people who died in the attack when hijacked planes hit the former World Trade Centre twin towers. The memorial with the names of the victims is now on the site of the collapsed WTC towers.
"We need to remember what happened here, the horror of it all," said Babiš. The Prime Minister described the September 11, 2001 attack on the USA as the reason why the United Nations should cooperate in the joint fight against international terrorism. As well as destroying the WTC towers, the terrorists crashed one of the hijacked planes into the Department of Defense building in Washington, D.C. They were also planning to hit another target in Washington, D.C., presumably the White House or the Congress. However, this plane fell down when the passengers stood up to the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy. All countries around the globe should join in the coordinated fight against international terrorism," added the Czech Prime Minister.
Slovenes have defeated the Polish world champions and are now in the European Championship finals
Slovenian volleyball players are set to have a smashing time as they play for the premier title at the European Championship. Supported by nearly 12 thousand roaring fans in Ljubljana, they beat the reigning two-time world champions, Poland, with a score of 3-1, and are now the first finalists.
Which team they'll challenge in the grand finale in Paris on Sunday will be decided on Friday following the match between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team looked much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. The latter were only doing well at the beginning of the first set and, with some luck, at the end of the second set. However, the home players were surpassing themselves in their defence, while practically the only player to score points for the team in red-white jerseys was León, a Cuban-born player.
As for the home line-up, both spikers Čebulj and Urnaut presented themselves in their best form, and so did the second opposite spiker Štern, who soon replaced insipid Gasparini. The Poles felt the consequences of having been clear winners of all prior matches in this Euros, while the Slovenes have been gaining confidence after tough battles in play-offs against Bulgaria and Russia.
Slovenia was beaten by Poland with a score of 1-3 in the Olympics qualifier in Gdańsk in August, but retaliated the defeat on their home ground. However, they will now leave the sold-out Stožica arena in Ljubljana. Today's match has secured them the second medal in their history, nevertheless. In Paris, they can improve their unexpected silver from the European Championship held four years ago.
Slovenia placed eighth in the last European Championship, below the Czech Republic's national team.
Technology companies want to rule our cities
History is having its revenge on Francis Fukuyama. In 1992, at the height of the liberalism wave that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political theorist wrote in his most famous book ‘The End of History and the Last Man’: "What we may be witnessing … is the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalisation of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government."
Twenty-six years later, from the USA to Russia, Turkey to Poland, and Hungary to Italy, we tend to see more illiberal models taking the lead, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism are advancing. Fukuyama's new book (his ninth) titled ‘Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment’, seeks to grapple with these rising forces. In his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman it was apparent that he has re-evaluated many of his former views: he claims that the ideas of socialism should return to the public space, and Marx was right in many aspects. At the same time though, he maintains that his thought development is still in tune with his stance in the 1990s, and that the critics of ‘The End of History and the Last Man’ must have misunderstood the book.
"What I said back then is that one of the problems with modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that … liberal democracies don't even try to define what a good life is. It's left up to individuals, who feel alienated, without purpose, and that's why they form identity groups which give them a sense of belonging."
In its own time, ‘The End of History and the Last Man’ was written as a strong argument against Marxists who regarded Communism as humanity's final stage of history. When asked how he now viewed the resurgence of socialists in Britain and the USA, Fukuyama said: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we're talking about the ownership of the means of production – except in areas where it's clearly called for, like public utilities – I don't think that is going to work. If you mean redistributive programmes that try to redress this huge imbalance in both incomes and wealth that we're witnessing, then yes, it may come back. I think not only can it come back, it ought to come back. This extended period, which started with President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which a certain set of ideas about the benefits of unregulated markets took hold, in many ways it has had a disastrous effect."
In conclusion, Fukuyama tries to ease the current state of affairs and warns all liberals that the emergence of new, not fully democratic, regimes is not going mean the end of history.
Soldiers are rehearsing, close your curtains. China prepares for celebrations on a massacre site
The army has been rehearsing the parade over the past few weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to draw their curtains. Military vehicles rolled in empty streets going towards the square, while fighter planes circled the sky.
Several Chinese people told Reuters they were proud that their country would show off its military might. Still, one woman said that it could hardly be ignored that the celebrations would unsettle other countries.
She was probably referring to Taiwan, which China claims and which has an upcoming election now. There may also be some concern in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people keep protesting against the Chief Executive appointed by China.
Preparations for the celebration are also underway outside Beijing. Xiamen, a seaport in South China, saw a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen is situated opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
The list of things that have been banned in the run-up to the anniversary keeps growing. The Guardian reports that items like drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves are already on the list. The newspaper also adds that Weibo, a popular Chinese social media website, is deleting "harmful political information".
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Communist Party of China has remained (in power) against all predictions," said Maura Cunningham, a historian who specializes in China. "This is a time the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 after the Communists, led by Mao Zedong, defeated Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists, who then retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China was subjected to a catastrophic Communist experiment in the form of the Cultural Revolution. In June 1989 the regime massacred with tanks thousands of pro-democratic protesters, mostly students and workers, in Tiananmen Square.
Since the late 1970s, China has been gradually adopting more and more elements of the capitalist economic system. Critics say that China is now a mixture of the worst elements of both Communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) Capitalism (exploitation of workers).
No Czechs or children permitted. The Czech Trade Inspection Authority uncovers discrimination in restaurants
Among these shortcomings were misleading price information and the failure to abide by the rules of honest trade practice.
In one discrimination case, a Prague restaurant refuses entry to young children. According to the Czech Trade Inspection Authority, the restaurant's website says that their premises are not suitable for children up to the age of eight. "When we enquired online whether it would be possible to book a table for four adults and a 4-year-old child, a member of the restaurant's staff replied also online that no children under eight are allowed entry to the premises," added Fröhlich.
In the other discrimination case, a different Prague enterprise would not seat Czech-speaking people at a table, whereas English-speaking people were allowed to sit down. "Czech-speaking inspectors, who visited the place as customers, were not allowed to sit down at a table and place an order. English-speaking consumers were free to do so," a spokesperson for the Czech Trade Inspection Authority described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in an administrative procedure. As the cases have not been resolved with a final legal decision yet, the spokesperson for the Inspection Authority could not give us any more details about the aforementioned restaurants.
Cases of discrimination were uncovered in just a very small number of restaurants that were inspected in the second quarter of the year. The Czech Trade Inspection Authority conducted 139 inspections in total. In addition to the two discrimination cases, 64 other cases of malpractice were found. These were mostly shortcomings in complying with the rules of honest trade practice and the failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
On Wednesday, the Inspection Authority informed of the discrimination of foreign nationals in two restaurants in Prague, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreign customers were charged more than Czech-speaking clients. In these two cases, legally enforceable fines of CZK 60,000 have been issued.
Going on holiday only with a payment card? NEO account offers free withdrawals from cash machines all over the world!
According to surveys, around half of all Czechs who go abroad are now accustomed to paying directly by card. Some of the main reasons are, above all, comfort and safety, as well as the option to take out travel insurance which often comes with the payment card.
The comfort of paying by card can be fully appreciated by travellers in almost all corners of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, although payment cards are accepted almost everywhere these days. "People who travel frequently, for example on business, don't have time to make regular trips to bureaux de change to exchange their cash. "Holidaymakers" also do not want to rely on whether their cash is going to last. In addition, Czech banks and exchange offices do not even have some foreign currencies in stock. We have therefore provided NEO account with a feature that allows the account holders to withdraw cash from all cash machines free of charge, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, an Expobank CZ spokeswoman, who is also the Director of Marketing and Communication.
Unlike cash, a payment card is safer in terms of not losing money. When a full wallet is lost, the owner may not necessarily be reunited with the money that was inside. However, if it's only a payment card that gets lost, the holder can block it immediately, which can be done easily by phone or via online banking. If they act fast, they may not have to suffer any financial loss whatsoever. "As well as the reliable protection, there are other advantages to keeping money on a bank account. For instance, NEO account has an annual interest rate of 1.6 per cent, which is one of the highest among both current and savings accounts. The account can be opened and operated fully online without having to visit a branch. Furthermore, the money on the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand Euros, and there is no fee to maintain the account," adds Kateřina Petko.
Travel insurance should be a must for everyone who plans to go abroad. Insurance can be arranged in the last minute thanks to the option to apply and pay for it online by card. However, the very fact of holding a payment card can often mean that the holders are covered by insurance while they travel. "For example, MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business embossed cards have travel insurance integrally included, which covers travelling abroad to all countries around the globe. Holders of these cards can also insure their family members who travel with them. Often, they don't need to do any further arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko of Expobank CZ. It is always advisable, though, to confirm the extent of the individual insurance cover, such as whether it covers all the activities the travellers are planning to do.
Motivated immigrants needed. A senior consultant at a children's clinic puts together an international team of doctors, we bring you their stories
Ledjona Toni is an Albanian national who studied medicine in the Czech language. Today, hardly anyone can tell she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medical students from abroad study in Czechia, where they could later stay and work. Some of them were asked by the Paediatric Clinic at Motol in Prague to work there.
Tara Hussein Tayeb had to get up very early in order to arrive at Motol Hospital in Prague by 5 p.m. The short-haired Kurdish woman flew over to Czechia from Sulaymaniyah, a city in northeast Iraq, where she works as a paediatrician at a hospital. Furthermore, she treats young patients in a private practice in the afternoons. She also teaches at university.
Spilková on par. She is about to advance to the next round after the first round in Indianapolis
Golfer Klára Spilková is about to advance to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. She played two birdies, two bogeys, and finished on par on the first day of the LPGA tournament on Thursday. With a result of 72, she finished tied for 69th place, which is the expected cut.
Spilková (24) returned to the course a month ago after a two-month medical break and failed to advance to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She had taken some rest due to tiredness and exhaustion after an untreated illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament at the European LET series is a member of the LPGA Tour this year for the first time, and has not been doing very well so far. Out of twelve tournaments, she made the cut three times. Her best place was 32nd in Hawaii. She is thus fighting to keep the card for the next season.
The start of the tournament in Indianapolis was played best by South Korean Hur Mi-jung. After the first round, she had a score of -9 and is ahead of three competitors by two strokes.
The Prague Stock Exchange grows moderately; Czech banks, O2 and Avast are doing well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a moderate growth. The PX Index increased by 0.13 per cent (1038.45 points). It was pulled up by Czech banks, the O2 telecommunications company and the Avast technology company. Conversely, the Austrian titles and the CME media company did not do so well. This has been shown in the trading results on the Stock Exchange website.
The Prague Stock Exchange was trading in moderately positive territory throughout most of the trading session on Friday, and then closed the session with a small gain. "However, over the week the PX Index went down by a little over one per cent," notes Josef Dudek of Fio Bank.
Our banks have partially adjusted the decline of recent days. Komerční banka has improved its position by 0.82 per cent to 803 Czech crowns and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 per cent to 72.80 Czech crowns. Avast shares increased in value by 0.89 per cent to 113 Czech crowns and the O2 operator O2 increased by 0.46 per cent to 216.50 Czech crowns.
Kofola saw the biggest growth in securities, by 1.38 per cent to 294 Czech crowns. Just short of one per cent was gained by the Philip Morris tobacco company, whose shares went up to 13,640 Czech crowns.
The shares of the ČEZ energy company stagnated at the Thursday value of 520 Czech crowns.
Three titles dropped – Erste Bank has written off 0.87 per cent to 779.20 Czech crowns, CME 0.73 per cent to 109 Czech crowns and the VIG insurance company 0.40 per cent to 618 Czech crowns.
The Czech crown has slightly depreciated against the two major world currencies. The Czech crown has lost value by four hellers against euro (down to 25.85 CZK/EUR), and three hellers against US dollar (down to 23.62 CZK/USD), according to the information published on the Patria Online website.
A heart as strong as steel and a non-smoker's lungs. I'll just have a few infusions, jokes Zeman
On Tuesday, the Head of State underwent a health check in the Central Military Hospital (CMH) lasting several hours. Miroslav Zavoral, the Director of the Hospital, says that no "ailing conditions" have been found in the President. The President's 75th birthday is this Saturday.
The doctors detected mild signs of dehydration in the President. Poor hydration is the cause of his low blood pressure problems. "To re-hydrate my organism I will receive a few infusions, which will transport minerals into my body," said Zeman.
In the words of the Director of the CMH, other than that, "the Czech lands have a healthy President", said Zeman. In reference to this, the President mentioned that Zavoral had received a few hateful messages because of this health check.
The President said that the doctors had examined him thoroughly and had not left out any part of his body. "So, here's a short recap: my heart beats like a drum, my lungs are as clear as if they were not the lungs of a smoker, my liver works as if I was a teetotaller, the kidneys are also alright and I could go on and on," said Zeman.
The iDNES.cz editors have contacted the Military Hospital asking them to comment on the claims made by Zeman about his health.
Zeman's health issues were talked about mainly during last year's presidential election, as well as during a number of public appearances where he had appeared to have difficulty walking. According to a statement from Prague Castle, the President's walking problem is caused by his diabetic polyneuropathy. He also suffers from low blood pressure and is hard of hearing. He has cut down on smoking due to his health.
Scientists look for toddlers with a congenital deformity called ankle valgus for a study
Ankle valgus (outward turning of the ankle) is a congenital deformity affecting five to ten per cent of children. It is routinely treated by intensive exercise. As scientists are trying to help these children even more, they have developed special footwear that should significantly speed the treatment up.
"We have two prototypes of shoes, which will be worn by both healthy children and those who have been diagnosed, in order to monitor the effects in both groups. The research poses no risk to the children, and the measuring will be completely pain-free," explains Marta Gimunová, the Head of Research at the Faculty of Sports Studies, Masaryk University.
Parents of both groups of children can register to participate in the study on the website where they can find a registration form and all information.
The scientists are looking for fifty children who have been diagnosed and fifty healthy children. Half of the children in each group will be wearing the surgical shoes while the other half won't.
"Parents should register their children for the study around the time they are taking their independent steps. This is typically when they let go off the furniture they hold on to in their attempts to walk. As part of the research, three measurements are taken over the course of seven months since the child took his/her first steps. Each measuring session is about 20 minutes long. The research also includes wearing the test shoes by half of the participants," Gimunová points out.
Pike in the pond, or a relatively wealthy open-air museum?
To support his optimistic views, Babiš has chosen to use statistical data analysing the good level of our security (the Czech Republic is the seventh safest country in the world), our low unemployment rate and low national debt, as well as the findings of one recent study which claims that our country is at 24th place when it comes to quality of life, out of the 140 countries compared in the study.
However, in a TV interview given during the Architecture and Development Summit, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot presented different data, which were a far cry from this "rosy picture". For instance the fact that the Czech Republic ranks 154th across the world when it comes to the speed of building permit processes. Therefore, it may as well happen that the current economic "boom" will not leave any significant construction legacy as it used to be the case in the past.
Both the current legislation and slow, inefficient bureaucracy are the biggest stumbling blocks here. This view is also supported by comparative studies which show the Czech Republic substantially lagging behind advanced countries in terms of the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Put simply, our country has not yet been able to make a good use of the potential afforded by the good economic situation of recent years for investing in the future. It's very well that our wages and retirement pensions are growing, but people whose living standard is going up will also want to have a decent place to live, have access to fast and modern modes of travel, good-quality cultural amenities and live without an unbearable burden on the environment.
Take our capital city, Prague, for instance – the construction of the outer and inner circular roads has been left unfinished for years, and a rapid transit or metro line that would go to the airport has not yet been built. Neither are there any state-of-the-art or architecturally bold buildings that would house Prague's national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason for this is not just ridiculous squabbling over architecture competitions, local plans and planning permissions, but also a characteristically Czech sort of conservatism which follows the mantra "any bold change is a change for worse".
When it looks like something a little more adventurous could be attained, it will almost definitely be thwarted by preservationists or other rather mulish leagues, and politicians. When the absurd drama behind the "the blob" designed by Jan Kaplický for a new National Library building kicked off, one of the people who wanted to chain themselves to the excavators was even President Václav Klaus himself.
The list does not end with Prague, though. The Czech Republic has not been able to finish its core motorway network yet, or start building rapid transit railways. Therefore in the end, Germany resorted to building their superfast railway, connecting Berlin and Vienna, with a "detour" through Bavaria. Moreover, even the repairs of the existing infrastructure are often shambolic, so it can now be a real conundrum to get fast from Prague to Brno.
Babiš came into politics with a promise to "get things done". As far as meaningful investment and the speeding up of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures are concerned, not much has been done so far. Even though the amendment to the Fast-tracking of Transport Infrastructure Construction Act has been in effect since 2018, we are still waiting for extensive positive impacts, such as an easier land dispossession process. The new, government-approved, Building Act, which was supposed to reduce the average time of the building permit process from 5.4 of a year down to one year, will reportedly come into effect in 2021, if we are lucky. However, there are not likely to be many people who would bet on it.
Nečesaný demands CZK 45 million from the state
The Ministry of Justice spokesman, Vladimír Řepka, said that six requests related to this legal case have been received so far and are presently being analysed by the Ministry. The young man served two years in prison for attacking the woman; however, the judiciary has now issued a final judgement to acquit him of charges.
Neither Prosecutor General Pavel Zeman nor Justice Minister Marie Benešová have brought an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of the hairdresser happened in Hořice in February 2013. The Hradec Králové Prosecutor's Office charged Nečesaný, who was a 20-year-old grammar school student at the time, with the crime. The prosecution maintained that he hit the woman multiple times in the head with a log and then took more than ten thousand Czech crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, and her life was saved by the doctors in Hradec Králové Hospital.
Nečesaný has been denying all accusations since the beginning of the trial. "I am innocent, and I can swear to it. I honestly feel sorry for what happened to the injured lady, but I am not the culprit here," said the young man in court, who had not denied that he indeed went to the hair salon on that ill-fated day. He said that he had wanted to have a hair-cut. He left after he had been told by the woman that she was about to close the shop. He then got in touch with the police of his own accord and came forward as a witness.
During the initial questioning by the police, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor. However, she identified Nečesaný as the attacker later. The court experts said that she was experiencing lapses of memory loss as a result of the attack.
The Regional Court in Hradec Králové pronounced five successive verdicts in relation to the case. Nečesaný was initially found guilty two times and was given a 16-year prison sentence. Then the High Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to 13 years. Nečesaný went behind bars twice consecutively, but was released both times after the Supreme Court's interventions. After the ordered change of the Chamber of Court, verdicts of not guilty were repeatedly issued, the last of which was confirmed by the High Court in March this year.
However, Jiří Lněnička, Chairman of the Appeals Chamber, stated in his reasons for this conclusion that this decision was wrong, but he had no other choice in the matter considering the circumstances of the trial. He said that he had dismissed the appeal against the not-guilty verdict made by the public prosecutor even though her objections in the appeal were justifiable.
"The problem in this legal case is not that there was not enough evidence, but the way the evidence was evaluated. We are of the opinion that enough evidence was gathered in the preliminary procedure, which would have been more than sufficient to issue a guilty verdict in different criminal cases," said Lněnička.
Nevertheless, both the Hradec Court and the High Court had a different view of the case, and their opinion is not likely to change even if the acquittal was invalidated.
His love for sport was made difficult by epilepsy, there is new hope thanks to an operation
The first time Honzík's parents noticed there was something wrong with him was when he was one and a half. He suddenly started staring into space for a few minutes, froze and stopped responding to those around him. His paediatrician thus sent him to a children's neurology clinic, where he underwent a series of examinations. He was then diagnosed with epilepsy and put on a course of medication, though this didn't start to help right away.
It took almost a year for the doctors to find an ideal combination of drugs that made the seizures stop completely. Then when he was five, the doctors took him off the medicines. Because the seizures didn't come back, his parents thought that Honza was healthy again and started to encourage him to do sports. He started to cycle, ski, play tennis and floorball. He spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. However, when he was eleven, he had another seizure and everything started again.
Doctors were again trying out all kinds of combinations of drugs, but this time nothing was working. His absence seizures kept coming back. Because Honza always blanked out during the seizures, his parents were worried sick that he may get a seizure while playing sports and hurt himself. Honza gradually phased out cycling and swapped his downhill skis for cross-country skis and a snowboard. Even though exercising triggered a seizure from time to time, he never gave up sports completely. He even fulfilled his dream of running in the Spartan Race, though a friend of his ran along and kept an eye on him at all times, in order to help if needed.
When Honza was 15, his parents decided they would like to try a different doctor and got in touch with the specialist doctors at Motol University Hospital. After a series of examinations, the hospital doctors concluded that Honza is a candidate for a surgery to remove the focus – source of the epileptic seizures – from his brain. "I had to undergo two consecutive operations. At first, the doctors implanted probes into my brain to monitor its activities. Only then they could remove the focus. For me, this was hell that lasted over several weeks. I had to lie in bed and practically stay still at all times. My head was full of wires sticking out and connected to a computer," recalls Honza.
The operation was a success. The doctors removed a relatively large focus. "It was very difficult for us mentally. Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and hardly spoke to us. This was such a contrast to how he is normally – lively and communicative. The change was drastic, but fortunately after a few days everything went back to normal," describes his mum and adds: "He had one seizure a month and a half after the operation, but the doctors say it does happen sometimes. Since then, he has been seizure-free for three months now."
Honza will take his final exams at secondary school this year. Beside sports, he also likes languages, and he started working with E Company by joining them in giving talks about epilepsy at schools. Honza doesn't do sports fully for the time being as he is taking it slowly. "I'm learning how to play sports in a way that's right for me and how to breathe correctly in order to avoid exposing my body to sudden stress, which is a bit tricky with my competitive nature, though," explains Honza.
Therefore, he is not actively taking part in this year's traditional EPPI River Sports Triathlon, where both epileptic patients and healthy sportspeople meet up. The triathlon is held at Veselí Sand Quarries this weekend on 28th September 2019. Hopefully he will take part next year.
Authorities permit XXX Lutz to buy its competitor, Kika. There is a catch, though
"The Office for Competition Protection has allowed a merger of competitors – XLCEE-Holding GmbH as one party, and the companies Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia as the other party, provided that the conditions of fulfilling structural obligations put in place in order to maintain effective economic competition will be met," said the OCP spokesman, Martin Švanda.
Beside the XXX Lutz retail chain, XLCEE-Holding also owns Möbelix stores. If they absorb the Kika retail chain as well, they'll cover too large a section of the Czech furniture and accessories market. They must therefore sell off a part of the company they are acquiring.
XLCEE-Holding is also acquiring Kika stores in other countries in which the retail chain operates, such as Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. The transactions in these countries must have permission from their antimonopoly authorities, as well. XXX Lutz announced in May that they were to acquire 22 foreign stores of the Kika retail chain from Signa Holding. Last year, Signa took over Kika for a symbolic price, as the company was on the verge of bankruptcy.
The Kika retail chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two here after Sweden's IKEA. Before it was acquired by the Austrian Signa company, it had been part of the South African Steinhoff International Holdings from 2013. Steinhoff was faced with problems when discrepancies had been found in their account books. Kika has nine retail stores in Czechia.
XXX Lutz has been operating in Czechia since 2010. It is one of the largest furniture retailers in this country, alongside IKEA, Sconto, Jysk, Asko Furniture and Kika. They also own the brand Möbelix. When XXX Lutz acquires Kika's foreign branches, they'll operate over 300 retail stores across 12 countries. Based on the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion Euros (approx. 114 billion Czech crowns).
A library marks the anniversary of Wenceslas IV's death with a manuscripts exhibition
Six precious historical manuscripts from the turn of the 15th century, i.e. the time of the reign of King of the Romans and King of Bohemia, Wenceslas IV, can be viewed in Prague Clementinum today and on Saturday. The National Library released the manuscripts from their vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas's death. Librarians and restorers placed the precious originals in the Mirror Chapel's showcases this morning. Admission to the exhibition is free of charge, and the opening times are from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on both days.
The documents exhibition titled ‘Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslas IV’ has been prepared by the Library in cooperation with the National Archives. The National Archives have conceptualized the written heritage created during the reign of Wenceslas IV from the official documents perspective, whereas the National Library from the perspective of literary works, commented on the exhibition its creator, Jan Vojtíšek.
"Visitors can look forward, for instance, to the writings on agriculture by Petrus de Crescentiis, which are basically a kind of rural encyclopaedia; or a breviary, which is a book of prayers that belonged to a Benedictine nun of St George's Convent at Prague Castle in the early 15th century," he lists the reasons why he thinks people should come and see the exhibition.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be on display, whose historiated initial H (enrico) features the half-figure of King Henry II of England. The ornaments were most likely created by the Master of the History of Samson, who in addition to two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV also created ornaments in a number of other manuscripts. Visitors can also view a Latin collection of tracts by John Wycliffe from around 1411 to 1414.
No books from Wenceslas IV's library survived in the Czech Republic. According to experts, the library used to have one of the largest and most beautiful book collections in Central Europe in those times, the result of the young King's desire to have a highly presentable library that would compare to the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library perished soon after Wenceslas's death. It is most likely that it was ransacked or destroyed when the castle was besieged by the Hussites. A few codices were saved, most of which are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"Our collections include a whole host of treasures, and I am glad that they are in a condition to be displayed and viewed by the public ‘live’ and not just via the Manuscriptorium digital library," said Martin Kocanda, the Head of the National Library.
On the National Holiday Saturday, a Clementinum exhibition called ‘What is Hiding under the Floor’ featuring local archaeological finds will also welcome visitors free of charge.
Kristýna Plíšková has not made it to the finals, she misses the second title
Tashkent has proved to be good for Plíšková. In 2016, she won her first WTA tournament there and played very confidently this year as well.
After winning over Paolini, Kawa and Kužmová, she advanced to the best four players.
However, the match against Alison Van Uytvanck was not going well for Kristýna. The Belgian did not drop her serve, and in the first set she broke Plíšková's service twice. In the second set Van Uytvanck soon took a 3-0 lead. Kristýna did not manage to turn the game around, despite successfully converting a break point in the end. In the last one, she fended off a match point, however it ended with the second one.
Petra Černocká changed her image and the result is great! She looks younger with blond hair
Petra Černocká (69), who played the movie character Saxana, looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Despite her upcoming milestone birthday in November, she has never looked like an old lady. And now she has helped her good looks even more. Her image is so different now that even her colleagues couldn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká has never looked like a typical grandma whose hair is threaded with grey, who dresses sedately and socializes very sporadically. She has always taken great care of herself. The older she gets, the more she feels free to experiment with her image.
Fortunately, she has never fallen victim to the trend of plastic surgery, and her skincare consists of applying good old Indulona. Her recipe against wrinkles is paying dividends now. Now she's also changed her hair colour and looks absolutely fabulous.
When she arrived at the social gathering where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, nobody could recognize Petra. Not only was her hair lighter and shorter, she was also sporting a yellow jacket, which made her shine even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana not to undermine themselves and be adventurous with their looks even when they are about to hit the age of 70. It has paid off for Petra, as she looks fifty at most.
Traveller Zikmund and General Boček. Commemorative medals given out by the Senate
Boček, a 96-year-old former fighter pilot who served in the British Air Force during the Second World War, thanked for the awarded medals on behalf of all awardees. "The Senate has always been, and still is, leading the way in remembering war veterans," he said among other things. "The awards I've received today also belong to those of my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against divisions in society. "Let's not forget our roots, which make us who we are and bring us together whether we want it or not. After all, these are precisely the values that our successful present has emerged from," said Kubera.
Among the awardees were Renata Cífková, a cardiologist and the most cited Czech female scientist; Petr Sáha, a long-serving rector at Tomáš Baťa University in Zlín; Václav Cílek, a geologist, writer, traveller and science populariser; Jiří Hamza, the president of the Czech Biathlon Union and vice-president of the International Biathlon Union; and František Paštěka. The Upper House awarded Paštěka a medal for his heroism in saving the lives of his neighbour and the neighbour's two-year-old granddaughter, when he pulled them out of their burning car in January this year. Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch, both former Chairs of the Upper House, also received medals.
Zikmund, together with Jiří Hanzelka, went on a series of travel expeditions all around the globe, during which they accumulated a good deal of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and broadcasting director in Free Europe Radio and is now working in public broadcasting media. Steigerwald is a playwright and screenwriter. Musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary committee that oversaw the relocation of the Soviet Army.
Luboš Perek, an astronomer and the emeritus chief of the United Nations Office for Outer Space, received his medal in advance, on the occasion of his 100th birthday in July. By the end of this year, these awards are to be given to Madeleine Albright, the Czech-born first female U.S. Secretary of State; and Roger Scruton, a British philosopher and political scientist, who among other things took part in running a so-called underground university in former Czechoslovakia during the communist regime.
An application that helps equip workshops. With points rewarded for moving around
New hand tools for the woodwork workshop in the Multi-Disciplinary School in Hodonín. This can now be earned by all those who download the ‘Give Help by Moving’ EPP application into their mobile phones.
"You can collect points by moving around and then credit them to our project's account. You don't need to be a competitive runner or cyclist. Points are earned even while you're walking the dog, going shopping, taking a stroll or walking to work," said Eva Schmidová, the Hodonín school's headteacher. The project is considered one of the most interesting among the huge number of projects submitted to the ČEZ Foundation. The application will be active for one month only.
Michael Jackson wore tape on his nose to get front pages, former bodyguard claims
Michael Jackson's former bodyguard has claimed the late singer cultivated some of his eccentricities with the deliberate intention of riling up the media.
Matt Fiddes, now a property developer and owner of a martial arts/dance chain, told Metro that Jackson believed the fascination around his persona would stop if he ceased to be a "mystery" in the public eye.
To get front pages, he would reportedly don surgical masks and put tape on his nose to spark conversation.
We'll tell you what's true. You can form your own view.
"He knew how to manipulate the media. He knew exactly how to get the front page," Fiddes, who was Jackson's bodyguard for 10 years, said. "90 per cent of the time it worked, by putting a mask on his face, or sticky tape on his hands - or tape on his nose was a favourite one. He would say he wanted his life to be the greatest mystery on Earth."
He added: "It's backfired on him now, though, that's the sad thing."
Fiddes also addressed allegations of child sexual abuse against Jackson by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, which were aired in the controversial, Emmy Award-winning documentary Leaving Neverland.
Both Robson and Safechuck allege that they were abused by Jackson as children for a number of years.
Fiddes claimed that "this whole paedophile thing is complete nonsense... the guy had girlfriends and had a legitimate marriage to Lisa Marie [Presley], that was the way he lived his life."
He claimed it would have been "impossible" for Jackson to have abused children at his Neverland ranch because he was "hardly" there.
"They say there were boys around, that was not the case at all," he said.
The Jackson estate has denied all allegations against the late star. Jackson denied all claims against him until his death in 2009.
Government Retires 15 More Senior Tax Officials On Graft Charges
New Delhi:
The government has compulsorily retired 15 more tax officers in the fourth tranche of its crackdown on errant officials accused of corruption and other malpractices.
The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) -- the agency that oversees GST and import tax collections -- compulsorily retired 15 senior officers under Fundamental Rule 56 (J) on corruption and other charges, official sources said.
Since June, this is the fourth round of sacking of corrupt tax officials. In the previous three rounds, 49 high ranking tax officers, including 12 from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), were compulsorily retired.
Sources said the action was in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort when he had said some black sheep in the tax administration may have misused their powers and harassed taxpayers, either by targeting honest assesses or taking excessive action for minor or procedural violations.
"We have recently taken the bold step of compulsorily retiring a significant number of tax officials, and we will not tolerate this type of behaviour," he had said.
Nearly half of the officials retired were those who were arrested by the CBI for allegedly receiving illegal gratification. One of them was caught accepting a bribe of Rs 15,000. One official is accused of having assets disproportionate to his known source of income.
In June, the government had compulsorily retired 15 commissioner-level officials of CBIC on charges of corruption, collecting and giving bribes, smuggling and even criminal conspiracy. Prior to that, the government had compulsorily retired 12 senior IRS officials from the Income Tax department over charges of corruption, sexual harassment, disproportionate assets under Rule 56 (J) of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules.
In August, the government compulsorily retired 22 CBIC officials. The Rule 56 (J) of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 provides for periodical review of the performance of government servants with a view to ascertain whether they should be retained in service or retired in public interest.
As per these instructions, the cases of government servants covered by FR 56 (J), 56 (1) or Rule 48 (1) (b) of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 should be reviewed six months before they attain the age of 50-55 years, in cases covered by FR 56 (j) and on completion of 30 years of qualifying service under FR 56 (1) or Rule 48 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.
A woman in Maine got 500 letters from United Healthcare within five days
Stephanie Lay said she found the piles of letters from the insurance company stashed in her mailbox between Thursday and Monday.
"A week ago Thursday was the first wave of letters, I got 46 letters," she told CNN. "I immediately called United Healthcare insurance and told them I received 46 letters of the same letter."
And the letters just kept coming, piling up to more than 500 by Monday.
They were addressed to her son, who has autism and lives in a private care facility, she said. But instead of her son's name inside when you opened them, the letters said Dear Maine's Department of Health and Human Services -- in Cincinnati, she told local media.
The letters were about a $54 or $0 healthcare claim that United Healthcare said is not covered, Lay said.
When she asked United Healthcare why she was receiving a mountain of letters, she was told it was a coding issue, she said.
In a statement, United Healthcare told CNN it's working to resolve the issue but it cannot provide details due to privacy requirements.
"We have determined the cause of the problem. We are very sorry this occurred, and we have contacted the family to discuss the situation with them," the health insurer said.
Lay said the letters all have a message at the bottom urging people to go paperless. " I'm thinking they had to take down half of a forest just to send this," she said.
Antonio Brown says he's not quite ready for retirement
Antonio Brown has indicated he's not retiring from the NFL, only a few days after announcing he was done with the league in a Twitter rant.
The four-time All-Pro wide receiver wrote on Twitter on Thursday: "I'm still the best why stop now." He followed with the suggestion that the game needs him.
Brown has been accused of sexual misconduct by two women. He was released by the New England Patriots last week after playing only one game. He's been dumped by three teams in the last six months.
Brown, who lost Nike as a sponsor last week, says he'll practice at high schools one day a week, starting in Miami.
The 31-year-old Brown also engaged in a Twitter spat with Los Angeles Rams safety Eric Weddle, who faced him often with the Baltimore Ravens.
HSBC flips crime-spotting tool to scope new business
British bank HSBC (HSBA.L) has converted a financial crime-spotting algorithm it was forced to build in the wake of a money-laundering scandal into one that can scope out new business opportunities, bank executives said.
The system combines data on clients" banking activities, with public data on company ownership and directorships, to flag desirable potential clients to HSBC staff and offer ways to connect to them through existing relationships.
Using data and artificial intelligence to try and boost revenues is part of HSBC's broader push to squeeze more out of its large physical network and client data, a key priority for interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.
"It's one of the first commercial uses of investment in financial crime prevention, and the business we're getting in this way is inherently lower risk and quicker to win," said Stuart Nivison, HSBC's global head of client network banking.
HSBC declined to comment on how much it expects to make from the new system but said the broader "network income" initiative has already yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.
The drive is an important part of the bank's efforts to defend its global presence at a time when some analysts and investors are saying it should shrink or exit markets like the United States where it makes returns below its cost of capital.
HSBC was forced to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in financial crime compliance as part of a $1.9 billion settlement in 2012 with U.S. authorities over the bank's failure to prevent money laundering by drug cartels though its Mexican unit.
The system works by mapping individual customers" and companies ties to each other and then looking for unusual patterns of transactions or unearthing previously unknown connections between those entities.
That system has already freed up more than 400 staff to go from manually checking transactions and records to client-facing roles where they can spend time helping customers, said Adrian Rigby, chief operating officer of HSBC's trade business.
HSBC's Nivison said the lightbulb moment was realizing the tool could be repurposed to look for "green flags" of attractive potential clients rather than "red flags" of wrongdoing.
"We took our customer dataset and combined it with (Britain's) Companies House data and turned the algorithm around to look for attractiveness in a client, whether that be through sector, growth of the company, and connection to existing clients," Nivison said.
The tool has mapped 22.5 million entities and people in Britain, and can identify in three minutes a network of connections that a staff member would have taken three hours to map out manually, he said.
Iran was promised that 'all' US sanctions would be lifted in return for talks, Rouhani claims
European nations were so eager to negotiate with Iran that they suggested the US would end its sanctions regime if Tehran was willing to engage in dialogue, President Hassan Rouhani has said.
According to Rouhani, European signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump, promising that Washington would lift "all" sanctions in return.
"Three out of the six countries, that is the chancellor of Germany, prime minister of Britain, and president of France, all insisted for the meeting to be held, saying that the US would lift all sanctions," stated the Iranian president.
He said he rejected the proposal because, "under sanctions and maximum pressure," it would have been impossible to predict the end result of any negotiations.
Trump quickly denied that he had offered Iran any relief, tweeting that Tehran had asked him to lift sanctions as a prerequisite to talks, but that he had "of course" refused.
In his statement, Rouhani also said that numerous countries were on Iran's side during their one-on-one talks on the sidelines of the UNGA. "We discussed various issues with various countries, and all of them condemned the United States" withdrawal from the JCPOA and its pressures. This is a huge success for Iran."
Dog control laws to be reviewed in government consultation
Dog control laws in Scotland are being reviewed amid concerns about out-of-control animals and irresponsible owners.
A consultation has been launched by the Scottish Government seeking the public's views.
Scotland's Community Safety Minister pledged to "keep communities safe from irresponsible owners," with reviews to determine whether laws for out-of-control dogs need changing.
Ash Denham MSP said: "We are holding two reviews into dog control legislation because we are absolutely determined to help keep communities safe from irresponsible owners and their out-of-control dogs.
"This consultation seeks views on improvements on how the Control of Dogs Act 2010 can operate across Scotland, and next year we will take a wider look at all dog control legislation to assess whether changes are needed.
"Owning a dog brings with it certain responsibilities, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage everyone with an interest in this area to respond to our consultation."
The consultation runs until January 15 and contains proposals to toughen and clarify the current legislation, including questioning whether a national dog control database should be created.
The Scottish Parliament's Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee has been hearing evidence from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs, prompting the Government to review dog control laws.
MSPs were told the legislation needs urgent reform to protect vulnerable people and children.
The committee heard that, in Greater Glasgow and Clyde alone, there were 1,417 people arriving at A&E departments with dog-related injuries, 255 of them children, last year.
NHS Lanarkshire treated 912 people and NHS Ayrshire 439, both four-year highs.
In July, the committee's MSPs concluded current dog control legislation is not fit for purpose and called on the Scottish Government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog-control laws.
Convener Jenny Marra said: "Dog law in Scotland is not fit for purpose. There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks.
"It has become clear that current dog control law doesn't work. It needs reform urgently so that out of control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly and we can try to move to a system that prevents our children being injured by dogs."
The consultation, launched on the Government's website on Friday, says: "Effective and consistent enforcement across Scotland is fundamental in helping address issues relating to out-of-control dogs.
"This review is focused on steps that can be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities, as they use their powers to help keep communities safe."
Saudi Arabia To Offer Tourist Visas For First Time, Abolish Abaya Rule
Visas in Saudi are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil.
Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.
The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which roiled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict.
"Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.
"Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty."
Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg News quoted Khateeb as saying.
Khateeb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to go without the body-shrouding abaya robe that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women.
Foreign women, however, will be required to wear "modest clothing," he added, without elaborating.
Visas in the desert kingdom, endowed with rich bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kickstart tourism.
But the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and has a strict social code, is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists.
Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liberalisation drive that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas to Saudi Arabia.
International criticism of the kingdom's human rights record, including the gruesome murder last year of critic Jamal Khashoggi and a crackdown on female activists, could further put off foreign visitors, observers say.
Fears of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Aramco may also dampen the kingdom's appeal to holidaymakers.
The government, reeling from low oil prices, says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030, compared to three percent currently.
It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists.
But the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to accomodate visitors in such high numbers, with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade.
The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs, the government says, as it battles high youth unemployment.
Saudi Arabia has splurged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch.
In 2017, the kingdom announced a multi-billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.
Last year, construction of Qiddiya "entertainment city" was launched near Riyadh, which would include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area.
The country is also developing historic sites such as the centuries-old Mada'in Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra.
Facebook hides 'likes' in new Australia trial
Facebook has begun hiding the number of "likes" for posts in Australia, it said today, a trial designed to ease social pressure that could be rolled out worldwide.
Account holders across the country will also be blocked from viewing the number of reactions and video views on other people's posts from today, but will still be able to see how people respond to their own.
"We don't want Facebook to feel like a competition," the company said in a statement.
"This is a test to see how people engage with this new format. We hope to learn from this over time in order to see if we will roll this out more broadly," it said.
More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide, but the social media giant has come under pressure to combat the platform's impact on mental health.
In Australia, one in five children report experiencing cyberbullying, according to the country's eSafety commissioner.
Facebook's decision comes after it launched a trial in July to hide "likes" on the company's other major social media platform, Instagram.
What began as a test on Instagram in Canada was expanded to Australia, Brazil and several other major markets.
The Facebook trial was described as "a limited test in order for us to get some early learnings."
"While this has been testing on Instagram, Facebook and (Instagram) are different surfaces and we will likely see different data come from this test," the company said.
The social media giant did not confirm how long the trial would run for.
"We want to understand from people whether removing the total counts improves their experience, while also not limiting any positive interactions," said Mia Garlick, of Facebook Australia.
Lorenzo strengthens into Category 4 hurricane east of Caribbean
Hurricane Lorenzo strengthened into a Category 4 storm Thursday, producing swells that could affect parts of the Windward Islands and South America, the National Hurricane Center said.
The eye of the major hurricane was about 1,660 miles southwest of the Azores in the NHC's 11 p.m. EDT update. The storm was moving north-northwest at 14 mph with 145 mph maximum sustained winds.
The storm isn't forecast to make landfall in the coming days, though a turn toward the northeast Saturday could bring Lorenzo near the Azores in the middle of next week. Forecasters predict the storm will weaken below Category 3 on Monday.
Swells generated by the storm could cause life-threatening surf and rip currents in the Windward Islands and northeastern South America.
Lorenzo is the season's second Category 4 or higher storm. Dorian reached Category 5 status near the Bahamas.
According to Colorado State University Meteorologist Philip Klotzbach, the Western Hemisphere, which encompasses the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins, has generated 16 named storms since Aug. 21.
"This is the most on record for the Western Hemisphere between Aug. 21-Sept. 23, breaking the old record of 15 named storms set in 1984 and 2002," he wrote on Twitter.
Patriot missile system to Saudi Arabia after Iran oil attacks
U.S. Soldiers talk after a routine inspection of a Patriot missile battery at a Turkish military base in Gaziantep, Turkey.
The Pentagon on Thursday announced that the U.S. will send a Patriot missile battery, radars and roughly 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the attacks on its oil facilities earlier this month.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has "approved putting additional forces on prepare to deploy orders," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman wrote in a statement. "While no decision has been made to deploy these additional forces, they will maintain a heightened state of readiness."
Those additional forces include two Patriot missile artillery batteries and one Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD missile defense system.
THAAD, one of the world's most advanced missile systems, can target incoming missiles and blast them out of the sky. THAAD interceptors, fired from a truck-based launcher, use kinetic energy to deliver "hit to kill" strikes to ballistic threats.
"It is important to note these steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East. Other countries have called out Iranian misadventures in the region, and we look for them to reinforce Saudi Arabia's defense," Hoffman wrote.
President Donald Trump slammed Iran's alleged role in the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, telling world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that they should pressure Tehran into diplomatic talks.
"All nations have a duty to act," Trump said regarding his call to counter Iranian behavior. "No responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust. As long as Iran's menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened."
The Sept. 14 strikes on the world's largest crude-processing plant and oil field forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations. The drone attacks triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a budding conflict in the Middle East. While Tehran has been widely blamed for the attacks, it maintains that it was not involved.
Skydiver dies after crashing into big rig trailer on California highway
The 28-year-old woman was skydiving with a group of seven people around 2 p.m. Thursday, California Highway Patrol PIO Ruben Jones told CNN.
The group took off from the Lodi Parachute Center. CNN has reached out to the facility for comment.
Conditions were windy, and the woman crashed into the truck during the skydiving group's descent near the Lodi Airport, Jones said.
The station spoke to Lisa Reyes, who was driving with her father and brother on Highway 99 when the woman crashed.
"The way the person was struggling, just struggling against the wind and their body was just moving really, really fast," she told the station.
'Hideous' Central Coast camouflage child rapist ordered to look at victim in court
Dressed in a leafy Ghillie camouflage suit, the man grabbed the then 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into bushland as she made her way to school on the state's Central Coast in May 2017.
He then tied her to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was executed at a home where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges involving the attack and a further three charges over the grooming and sexual abuse of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim had been walking along a track when she looked back and saw him suddenly emerge from the bushes armed with a large tree branch and a knife.
An example of a camouflage Ghillie suit the man used.
When she pleaded "stop, stop, stop," he put her in a headlock and forced her into the scrub.
The man told the girl: "Shhh, don't scream. Don't scream or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and feet with cable ties before lashing her to the tree and abusing her for almost an hour. After he cut her loose, the girl ran crying hysterically to school.
The man arrived at work about 9.30am after failing to reply to several text messages and phone calls from colleagues.
With dirt, grass and tree matter on his clothes, he claimed to have been involved in a road rage incident where he had chased another driver into the bush and fallen down an embankment.
The man's sentencing hearing continues on Tuesday.
No federal charges in fatal California police shooting
Federal authorities declined to pursue civil rights charges Thursday against Sacramento police officers who fatally shot an unarmed black man, a killing that sparked protests and spurred changes to a state law governing when authorities can use deadly force.
The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI said a federal review of the 2018 shooting of 22-year-old Stephon Clark found "insufficient evidence" to pursue charges against Officers Terrance Mercadal and Jared Robinet. Both will be returned to active duty.
The California attorney general's office in March declined to issue state criminal charges after a nearly yearlong investigation. Attorney General Xavier Becerra said then evidence showed the officers had reason to believe their lives were in danger because he was advancing toward them holding what they thought was a gun. Investigators found only a cellphone.
Sacramento police also announced Thursday their internal investigation did not find any policy or training violations.
"Although no policy violations occurred in this incident or in the events leading up to it, we are committed to implementing strategies that may prevent similar tragedies in the future," Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said in a statement.
Clark's brother, Stevante Clark, posted on Facebook Thursday that he was in a meeting with federal and local authorities. "These people have failed when it comes to (accountability)," he wrote.
Authorities have said the officers believed Clark was approaching them with a gun after he ran from them into his grandparents" backyard. The officers had been pursuing Clark after receiving calls about someone breaking car windows and an elderly neighbor's sliding glass door.
The officers shot Clark seven times as he approached them.
The federal investigation looked at evidence such as witness statements, audio and video recordings, dispatch records, police reports, and autopsy reports to determine whether the officers acted willfully with the intent to use objectively unreasonable force.
Lawmakers last month updated the nation's oldest law governing police use of deadly force, making it now among the country's most comprehensive when combined with additional training.
California's old standard made it rare for police officers to be charged following a shooting and rarer still for them to be convicted. It was based on the doctrine of "reasonable fear," meaning if prosecutors or jurors believed officers had a reason to fear for their safety, they could use lethal force.
The new law, which takes effect Jan. 1, will allow police to use deadly force only when "necessary" to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious injury to officers or bystanders.
Pope warns tech execs to use AI for the common good
Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.
Francis addressed a Vatican conference that brought government envoys and Facebook and Google representatives together with philosophers, physicists and ethicists. A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at "The Common Good in the Digital Age" conference.
The three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.
The debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.
In his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor. But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.
"If technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress," he warned. "If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest."
Organizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants" expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues.
The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall.
The Democratic-held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump's action by a 236-174 margin, sending it to the president. Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it. The Senate already approved the measure in a 54-41 vote, as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it.
Trump will likely veto the resolution, the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president. He already vetoed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March.
Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to override the president's opposition.
Failing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared the national emergency in February. His administration plans to pull $3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects.
Democrats have accused Trump of both circumventing Congress' power of the purse and raiding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers. A handful of Republicans in both the House and Senate also had concerns about the precedent Trump's declaration would set for executive overreach in the future.
Some Senate Republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote.
Google Marks Its 21st Birthday With a Doodle: All You Need to Know
Google is marking its own birthday today with a doodle. The doodle features a photo of a 90s' style computer with Google search page and date stamp for September 27, 1998, surrounded by confetti in Google colours. A smaller doodle with number 21 as candles, as a part of Google logo, shows on the search results page. The search giant was founded 21 years ago in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then students at Stanford University in California. September 27 is, however, not Google's actual birthday.
If you take the company's incorporation date as its birthday, then Google was born on September 4, 1998, however, the company never celebrated the day as its birthday, at least not in the form of a doodle. Google celebrated September 7 as its birthday in doodles until 2005, following which it switched to September 27.
Initially, the search engine was called "BackRub" and it was later renamed "Google."
"We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines," Sergey Brin and Lawrence (Larry) Page wrote in 1998 in a paper published about launching a prototype of a "large-scale search engine."
The company got its start thanks to Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim who invested $100,000; in June 1999, the company had raised a $25 million round from Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins. Google moved to its Mountain View location in the same year, where it remains. In 2001, the company was granted a patent for its technology.
What started out as a Web search engine has since turned into a massive conglomerate that calls itself Alphabet and Google is a subsidiary company. Today, Google operates all over the world in over 100 languages, answering trillions of search queries each year.
"The relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we do," Google writes on its Our Story page. "Today, with more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, Google makes hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe, from YouTube and Android to Smartbox and, of course, Google Search. Although we've ditched the Lego servers and added just a few more company dogs, our passion for building technology for everyone has stayed with us - from the dorm room, to the garage, and to this very day.
Oil falls after Iran claims US offered to remove sanctions, Trump denies
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani makes a speech during a ceremony in Tehran, Iran on January 10, 2019.
Oil slid after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed Friday that the U.S. offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for negotiations. President Donald Trump and the State Department later denied those claims, causing oil to rebound from the lows.
WTI crude futures were last down by 0.9% to $55.91 after falling as low as $54.79. Brent crude futures dropped 1.4% to $61.89.
"The German chancellor, the prime minister of England (Britain) and the president of France were in New York and all insisted that this meeting take place. And America says that it will lift the sanctions," Rouhani said on his official website, according to Reuters. "It was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they (the United States) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions."
Trump later said he responded "of course, NO!" to Iran who he said wanted him to lift the sanctions in order to meet.
The State Department called the report "baseless," adding the U.S. is committed to zero oil exports from the Iranian regime, Bloomberg News said.
Rouhani's comment came after a series of drones attacked oil facilities in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 14, which had forced the kingdom to cut production in half. The U.S. and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, have blamed the attack on Iran. Tehran has denied any role in the incident. The Trump administration also announced plans to deploy U.S. forces to the region.
The State Department didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
"There's been a big bearish risk from a thaw in the US Iran situation for some time and this will put a remarkable amount of oil back onto the market immediately if it were to occur," said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
"It's not just Iranian production and exports. Its' millions of barrels in floating storage and millions of barrels sitting in China's ports waiting to be processed by customs," Kilduff said.
Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal between Iran, the U.S. and five other countries that removed sanctions from the country in return for its commitment to end its nuclear.
The Islamic Republic, a target of U.S. sanctions for decades, was blamed by Washington for recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, which Tehran denies. Iran also shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. spies.
Afghanistan boosts security for presidential election
A massive security operation is in place across Afghanistan for the country's presidential election on Saturday.
About 100,000 security personnel are to guard polling stations in the wake of Taliban threats.
The fear of reprisals means many voters - particularly in rural areas - will stay at home, while others say the voting system favours the powerful, not the poor.
Royal news: How Princess Beatrice "reacted with fury at hostile family members"
On Thursday, The Duke and Duchess of York announced that their eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, is engaged to her boyfriend, the 34-year old property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The Princess, who is ninth-in-line to the throne, will tie the knot with Mr Mapelli Mozzi next year. The couple said in a statement: "We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together.
"We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness."
Princess Beatrice's parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, also shared their excitement.
The Duchess of York wrote on Twitter: " I know what a mother feels so I have tears of joy. I am so proud of this sensational news.
"Andrew and I are just the luckiest people ever to have two great sons in law."
The royal wedding will be another occasion for the entire Royal Family to get together, and hopefully completely repair Fergie's relationship with the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since Sarah was embroiled in one of the Royal Family's biggest ever scandals, her relationship with the rest of the members has been extremely difficult.
Five months after announcing she was separating from Prince Andrew in 1992, compromising photographs of her with her "financial advisor" were taken at her holiday villa in St Tropez.
The snaps appeared to show Texan millionaire John Bryan kissing and sucking the Duchess" toes and the arch of her foot, and Prince Philip in particular, is said to have had the strongest reaction to her daughter-in-law's scandalous antics.
However, his behaviour was reportedly "appalling" towards the Duchess of York, and Princess Beatrice once claimed her mother was the victim of "mean spirited actions to make her feel unwelcome."
JUST IN: Kate and William behind closed doors: Couple's shock habit exposed
The report noted that the Duchess" spokesman was unable to comment on the claims, but a friend of Fergie was quoted as saying: "It is no secret that Sarah's daughters are pretty fed up by the way their mother has been treated by some members of the Royal Family.
"Some of the bills she has been sent have been pretty miserly.
"They are constantly berating their father for allowing it to happen and Beatrice in particular has been imploring Prince Andrew to see that their mother is not treated as an outcast."
Philip and Sarah were pictured for the first time together in 26 years at Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank last October.
The Next Big Labor Strike Hits Oregon
The state university workers" most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work. The pay disparities alone are shocking. About half of these workers earn less than $40,000 per year (and hundreds make less than $25,000). Meanwhile, university presidents" annual salaries average out to $500,000 and four university athletics coaches are pulling down a cool $1 million. While school administrators enjoy six-figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to bloat, one in six classified staffers qualify for food stamps.
As Alejandro Segurra, another IT worker at Portland State University, said, "I'm willing to go on strike because I don't think it's fair that people are paid wages that don't allow them to live in the city that they serve." Portland State library worker Theresa Stapleburg was even more direct: "I want to strike because I've been here 24 years, and I need a raise - a living wage."
As inflation climbs and the cost of living in Oregon soars, these workers are being left to flounder, and management has shown little sympathy for their plight. Contract negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-August. At that point, the bosses had laid out some particularly egregious proposals - a paltry cost-of-living increase, a denial of seniority demands from long-term university workers, and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as disrespectful, and even cruel. "There is an unwritten class system at the universities," Fulmer said. "And we are at the bottom of it."
"Education workers have been under attack for decades," he continued. "We are finally standing up and fighting back. It's one thing to see classism and the squeezing of the middle class in the corporate world as executives see their relatively obscene pay continue to go up at rates above inflation. But for the same thing to be happening in education is not something workers will continue to tolerate."
And Oregon's state university workers aren't the only ones taking action. Oregon is a powder keg of militancy right now, and its fuse is now burning bright and hot. Grocery store workers at the Fred Meyer supermarket chain are ramping up their campaign against their employer, and while there are no official plans to strike yet, tensions are running high; their union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, has already called for a boycott, and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain.
In the healthcare sector, the 4,500 members of the Service Employees International Union Local 49 workers at Kaiser Permanente authorized a strike (with a 98 percent approval rate) if a deal isn't reached before their existing contract expires in October - which was only narrowly avoided with a new tentative agreement. Elsewhere in the industry, the Oregon Nurses Association, which represents more than 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital, has been deadlocked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration; their last contract expired in May, and the clock is ticking.
"Oregon has a really strong labor movement that is really building from the ground up," Burley explains. "This is a part of the national wave of labor growth. People are seeing a precarious economy where real wages are falling and the solution is collective action in the workplace."
It's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall, but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the Northwest in 2019. And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further, into the heart of Midwestern farming, Southern manufacturing, Texan oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeastern construction, the Silicon Valley tech giants, and everywhere in between. Lord knows that something's gotta give.
Civility in Politics: New awards scheme set up to counter Westminster division and recognise politicians who show courtesy
A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work.
It comes after a divisive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament.
It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
To counter the division, the "Civility in Politics" awards were announced on Friday, with the politician of the year to be awarded £3,000 to give to charity.
Boris Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber
Lord Stewart, announcing the awards, said: "Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility.
"As divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit, we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mirroring these trends, but by bucking them.
"These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persuasions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with decency and civility, and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all."
Nominations will open on Saturday, with an award ceremony in March next year.
In an exclusive interview with the Standard, former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd today accused Mr Johnson of deploying aggressive language that "does incite violence."
Mr Johnson, for his part, said he "deplores" threats made against MPs.
Jess Phillips 'frightened' after receiving 'be afraid' death threats
On Thursday, Labour MP Jess Phillips - another one of those to have criticised Mr Johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to "kick the door" of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a "fascist."
Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, meanwhile, was speaking to police following threats made to one of her young children.
And in a viral Twitter thread, Ellie Cooper, the daughter of senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper, described her fears for her mother in the wake of Ms Cox's murder . She accused Mr Johnson of "using language that helps incite violence toward MPs."
Setting the example? Income inequality in the US is at an all-time high
Last year the income gap between richest and poorest people in the US stood at its highest level since 1967, the first year the Census Bureau started tracking it. DC and New York are among places where the differences are worst.
The US may be the world's wealthiest nation, but it is also one where the super-rich thrive no matter what while the desperately poor often rely on GoFundMe to pay their medical bills. The economic inequality affects both wealth and incomes, with the latter being at an all-time high.
One way to measure income inequality is the Gini index. It measures between 0, a score for absolute equality and 1, which stands for a hypothetical situation in which a single household gets all income in a nation. The Census Bureau has been tracking the index for over 50 years. In 1967 it stood at 0.397 but, in 2018, it rose to 0.485, the highest figure on the record.
There are nations with worse income inequalities, including some with reasonably strong economies. For example, the World Bank estimates that South Africa's Gini index stood at 0.63 in 2014 while Brazil's was 0.53 in 2017. By comparison, all EU countries have a Gini index below 0.4.
The new data shows that income inequality is most acute in places where wealth is concentrated, including DC, New York and Connecticut, as well as in poverty-ridden areas like Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality.
The census also showed a stagnating growth of median household income, which grew to over $62,000. It's the highest level ever measured by the American Community Survey, but the increase was just 0.8 from 2017 to 2018, much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years and amounting to virtually no growth at all if adjusted to inflation.
The new statistics will likely put some wind into the sails of progressive Democratic contenders for the party nomination for next year's presidential election, who call for leaning on the super-wealthy individuals and on big corporations to pay more taxes.
It may also undermine the rationale behind the current administration's corporate tax breaks, which were passed through Congress in 2017. The goal was to convince multinationals to bring back manufacturing jobs as money trickles down to the middle and poor classes. In practice, it seems, it led to extra bonuses for executives and the rest of the country largely missing out on the benefits a growing economy and record low unemployment. Well, someone needs to pay for all those private jet trips.
North Carolina man wins five times in the same lottery drawing
A North Carolina man won five times in the same lottery drawing, including a $163,634 jackpot.
Add Lancaster of Pikeville told North Carolina Education Lottery officials he used five sets of his own numbers to buy a Cash 5 ticket with five plays for Monday night's drawing when he stopped at Wissam & Brothers Inc. in Pikeville.
"My wife writes down the numbers for me during the drawing," Lancaster said. "When she handed me the paper, so I could check my ticket, I couldn't believe it. One of my lines matched five numbers and the other ones matched four numbers. I started shouting, 'I got it! I got it! I hit the lottery!'"
Lancaster's line that matched all five numbers earned him the $163,634 jackpot, while the lines that matched four numbers each won $250.
The winner said he plans to use the money to pay his bills and make some home repairs.
Khloe Kardashian's cheating ex Tristan Thompson leaves ANOTHER desperate comment on her Instagram pic after rumours he wants her back
KHLOE Kardashian's cheating ex Tristan Thompson has left ANOTHER desperate comment on her Instagram page following rumours that he wants her back.
The 35-year-old star dumped the NBA player for good earlier this year after he was accused of cheating on her with family friend Jordyn Woods - having previously cheated when she was nine months pregnant with their daughter, True.
Tristan was spotted leaving another gushing compliment on Khloe's Instagram page
However, 28-year-old Tristan is refusing to give up without a fight - leaving a cringeworthy compliment on his ex's latest selfie.
In the blurred snap, Khloe is stood in front of the rising sun, with the mum-of-one captioning the pic: "May you have the courage to explore every dream you dream."
Publicly commenting, Tristan wrote: "The sun is shining bright on a beautiful [diamond emoji]."
Fans were outraged by the remark, with one replying: "Yeah, a diamond that you DROPPED."
Tristan cheated on Khloe when she was nine months pregnant
Another advised: "Just get off Instagram."
A third wrote: "Don't fall for it Khloe."
It comes just days after Tristan wrote: "Perfection" alongside the heart eye emojis underneath one of the reality stars other photos, which saw her modelling for Guess Jeans.
Earlier this month, The Sun revealed that Tristan bought Khloe a £400,000 Porsche in a bid to win her back - on the advice of Drake.
He was then accused of cheating again earlier this year - with Kardashian family friend Jordyn Woods
He settled on the grovelling gift, thought to be a 911, after being urged to pull a "power move" by his rapper pal.
As a result, pals said Tristan even won an invite from Khloe to a 'Taco Tuesday' dinner at her mansion - bringing him one step closer to a reunion with the reality star and their 17-month-old daughter True.
A source said: "Tristan is good pals with Drake and has been using him as a sounding board as he plots his return to the Kardashian fold.
Khloe was left heartbroken by Tristan's infidelity
"Drake told him to pull out all the stops if he wanted to win Khloe back.
"An invite to a casual dinner might not sound like a reasonable trade off for a sleek supercar.
"But after what Tristan did, he can't expect Khloe to roll out the red carpet for him."
The pair are mum and dad to 17-month-old True
Khloe Kardashian breaks down in tears and screams at cheating boyfriend Tristan Thompson in new Keeping Up With The Kardashians series 16 trailer
The Sun revealed last month that Tristan planned to invite Khloe on a romantic trip to Greece after vowing: "I will get my family back."
Khloe has been left heartbroken by Tristan's repeated cheating throughout their romance, but still invited him to their daughter True's first birthday party earlier this year.
However, the star's family reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians later showed that the event ended with Khloe in tears as she struggled to come to terms with his infidelity.
Stem cells of 56 child cancer patients lost at Children's Hospital after freezer malfunction
A freezer malfunction at Children's Hospital Los Angeles resulted in the loss of 56 children's blood stem cells that were harvested at the beginning of each patient's oncology therapy and stored in the event they could prove useful in the future.
"We apologize for any distress or confusion that this has caused our patients and their families," the hospital wrote in a statement. "If you have not received a letter or phone call from our team, your child is not impacted."
All but one patient had gone through initial therapy. That patient did require the recollection of stem cells, chief medical officer James Stein said.
A letter sent to families earlier in September informing them of the loss was accidentally addressed to the children - rather than the parents. The hospital has also apologized to parents for the messaging oversight.
The hospital said that the loss of stem cells, which had been placed in long-term storage, has not jeopardized any child's health. The hospital has also offered to assist families who want to harvest again. But the process can be grueling.
One of the patients described it as "painful." Sean Anderson Corona, 13, underwent stem cell therapy when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma - a cancer often found in the adrenal glands. The boy was hooked up to machines for a daylong process that collects the stem cells from the blood. The blood is then reinfused back into the body.
"I would try to sleep and my body would just start shaking, and then I just started to freak out and I'd start crying," Corona told ABC-7.
Corona will be cancer-free for three years in November. But his mother, Elizabeth Anderson, said that she worries that if his cancer does return, it may be impossible to harvest more stem cells from his blood.
Stein said that the recollection of patients" stem cells would only be recommended in the event that they are needed in the event that the patient relapses.
"We think that's going to be incredibly unlikely so we wouldn't ask anyone to do that in advance," he said.
The freezer has since been replaced, and the sensor-monitoring and alert system have been upgraded.
"Obviously, this is a huge deal for us." Stein said. "We're reaching out directly to every single family in person to make sure that all their questions are answered."
Prince Harry walks across Angolan minefield to reconnect with Princes Diana's legacy
It's day six of the Duke of Sussex' royal tour of Africa with his wife Meghan and baby Archie. But Friday morning, Harry returned to Angola alone to reconnect with the legacy of his late mother, Princess Diana.
Diana's legacy was brought full circle when Harry donned the distinctive blue body armor of the HALO Trust. Twenty-two years ago, Diana took a similar path across an Angolan field scattered with deadly landmines, left over from years of civil war. It became one of the most iconic images of her short life.
Wearing protective body armor and a visor, Diana, Princess of Wales, visits a minefield being cleared by the charity Halo in Huambo, Angola, January 15, 1997.
She was campaigning to rid the world of this weapon of war, but never lived to see her success, dying just months before an international treaty banned landmines in December 1997.
Over two decades later, the world is still not free of these devices. And echoing his mother, loud and clear, Prince Harry detonated a recently detected mine.
"Landmines are an unhealed scar of war," Prince Harry said. "By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity."
Prince Harry detonated a recently detected mine in Angola.
Thomas Cook pension trustees plot deal to salvage payouts
Thomas Cook's pension funds have kicked off talks with specialist insurers about a deal to salvage the collapsed travel group's retirement scheme benefits.
Sky News has learnt that Steve Southern, chair of the trustees, is holding talks with several parties about a buyout deal that would avoid most of Thomas Cook's 14,000 pension scheme members facing a steep cut to their payments.
Any deal with an insurer would be likely to involve a more modest cut to payouts than the 10% triggered by a pension scheme's transfer into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) lifeboat.
The discussions are at a very preliminary stage and - even if successful - will not result in a deal until after the Thomas Cook schemes have been through an assessment by the PPF.
Thomas Cook bosses face investigation into what led to collapse
That period could take up to two years, and if the schemes do enter the PPF will result in roughly 10,000 future pensioners having their payouts cut by 10%.
Sources said that a number of pension risk transfer specialists, as well as at least one of the new "superfund" consolidation vehicles, were in talks with Thomas Cook's trustees about a deal.
News of the trustees' efforts to secure members' benefits comes four days after Britain's oldest tour operator ceased trading, sparking an international repatriation programme and triggering thousands of job losses.
Thomas Cook's descent into insolvency has sparked a bitter blame game, with board members, government ministers and auditors all facing demands to explain their actions in the months before its collapse.
The company's four pension schemes are well-funded, with a £100m surplus on a PPF basis, according to the latest figures.
Collectively, they hold assets worth about £1.5bn.
However, as Sky News revealed last month, the trustees' demands for better terms in Thomas Cook's proposed rescue deal added a further complication to efforts to get the transaction across the line.
Thomas Cook's liquidation brought to an end 178 years of solvent trading, prompting the launch of inquiries by the government's Insolvency Service, the accounting watchdog and an influential committee of MPs.
Ministers have established a taskforce to address the crisis, which has left creditors facing meagre returns from the post-insolvency sale of assets.
To date, just under half of Thomas Cook's overseas British customers have been flown home.
Its collapse came hours after Thomas Cook issued a last-gasp plea to its lenders to reduce a £200m funding demand.
What went so wrong for Thomas Cook?
The talks, which concluded without a deal on Sunday evening, represented a frantic last throw of the dice for a company which had been forced to seek more than £1bn in new funding following a £1.5bn half-year loss and deteriorating trading.
Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by a 32-year-old cabinet-maker and former Baptist preacher who began offering one-day rail excursions from Leicester to Loughborough for a shilling.
From there, it went on to become one of the world's largest holiday companies, marking its 175th anniversary three years ago.
A PPF spokesperson said: "Insolvency events, like the liquidation of Thomas Cook, are exactly why the PPF was set up.
"We are here to protect the financial futures of members belonging to defined benefit pension schemes and they should take comfort knowing we are here to protect them."
A spokesman for Thomas Cook's pension trustees declined to comment on Friday.
Adorable pictures show new-born rhino nuzzling her mother and exploring new home
Baby Stella was welcomed into the world at Cotswold Wildlife Park, Oxfordshire, earlier this month and is the first female born to parents Monty and Ruby.
The youngster, who is healthy and nursing well, can be seen wondering about her enclosure before resting alongside her mother on a bed of straw.
Mother Ruby joined the wildlife park in 2009 alongside another female called Nancy in the hope that one would produce the park's first ever calf with Monty.
Nancy then gave birth to a female named Astrid in 2013, with Stella being the third female calf born at the park in its 49-year history.
Jamie Craig, curator of Cotswold Wildlife Park, said: 'We have had tremendous success with our current rhino herd.
'Stella is the sixth youngster from Nancy and Ruby and our bull, Monty, has proved to be an excellent dad.
'He is the perfect combination of a dominant bull and caring patriarch.
'It is particularly satisfying that Ruby has produced a female calf - these are vital for the development of the breeding programme and Stella will eventually move to another collection to hopefully become a successful mother herself.'
Ruby has had two boys before, Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017. Alan is still at the park whilst Ian is in Torino Zoo in Italy
When Alan was just one-week old he weighed around eleven stone.
Births in captivity are considered extremely rare. Females only reproduce every two-and-a-half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.
According to the park, a typical gestation period lasts between sixteen to eighteen months, after which a single calf is born.
It is considered the longest gestation periods of any land mammal, surpassed only by the twenty-two month gestation period of an Elephant.
A newborn Rhino calf will stand up within one hour of birth. Once born, the calf will immediately attempt to suckle, although he or she may be a little unsteady on their feet for the first few days.
It will remain under the watchful eye of the mother, suckling from her for approximately one year.
Their bond is an intensely strong one and the calf will remain with its mother for at least two years, benefiting from her protection. Females guard their offspring aggressively and are intimidating adversaries if challenged.
Incel virgin Alex Minassian told Toronto police he was part of 4chan group
Footage has emerged of a man alleged to have killed 10 pedestrians in Toronto telling police that he was part of an online group for sexually frustrated men.
Alek Minassian, 26, said that he was part of the involuntary celibates (incel) forum on 4chan.
He is now facing 10 counts of murder in Canada and 16 counts of attempted murder following the attack on April 23, 2018.
When asked about the deaths, he told police: "I feel like I accomplished my mission."
When the incident happened, it brought attention to the online world of loneliness, rage and misogyny.
Minassian said that he had contact with a killer in California who was angry at women who had rejected him.
He stands accused of driving a rental van into crowds of pedestrians in a busy north Toronto neighbourhood. Eight women and two men ranging in age from 22 to 94 died.
Minassian has yet to enter a plea. His trial begins in February, but a publication ban on his interrogation by police was lifted today. The police interview took place just hours after the attack.
Minassian, who said he never had a girlfriend and was a virgin, acknowledged he used the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks.
He said: "I know of several other guys over the internet who feel the same way," but added that they are "too cowardly to act on their anger."
Minassian calls himself an "incel," short for "involuntary celibate." The incel movement is an online subculture linked to the deadly attack in Toronto as well as attacks in California and Florida. It promotes the misogynistic idea that men are entitled to have sex with women.
Over time, "incel" has become a buzzword for certain men infuriated at being rejected by women and prone to float ideas for violent payback, according to sociologists and others who study them.
Like-minded people in internet forums sometimes use "Chad" and "Stacy" as dismissive slang for men and women with more active sex lives.
Minassian said he discussed his sexual frustrations on the website 4chan, which has become notorious as a place for extremists to post their views.
US theater chain bans dressing up for "Joker" screenings over fears of another shooting
The largest US independent theater chain won't let people in cosplay watch the critically acclaimed origin story of Batman supervillain "Joker." Face paint and masks are already banned, but safety fears still remain.
Most US cinemas have banned masks, face paint and toy weapons after the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which happened during a screening of another Batman flick, "The Dark Knight Rises." The gunman wore a Joker costume when he went on a gun and tear-gas rampage, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. Body costumes that don't hide a person's identity, however, have been generally allowed in theaters.
However, Landmark Theaters has now announced that it will not allow customers to wear costumes during screenings of the R-rated "Joker."
"I want customers to be comfortable in their surroundings," Landmark President-CEO Ted Mundorff told the Hollywood Reporter.
The company is based in Los-Angeles and runs 52 theaters in 27 markets, which makes it the biggest specialized theater chain in the country.
Meanwhile, Kansas-based AMC Theatres, the largest chain in the country, reiterated its ban on "masks, face paint or any object that conceals the face," but said they will welcome viewers in costume.
The ban on masks and fake guns was mostly due to practical security reasons, but as the release of "Joker" draws closer, there are concerns that it may trigger a copycat gun attack. The LAPD said it would "maintain high visibility" around theaters on premier day, while Regal Cinemas, the second-largest chain in the country, said it was implementing security protocols developed "in collaboration with NATO."
The US Army went as far as advising service members to watch out for "incels," disgruntled males who can't get a date, who supposedly idolize the Joker and may mimic his brutal ways.
"Joker," which is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, is due to be released on October 4 in the US, and is expected to become a box office hit. It follows the descent of a socially isolated and mentally unwell person, as he becomes the mass-murdering, green-haired, pale-faced nemesis of Batman.
It received rave reviews at its Venice International Film Festival premiere this year, taking the top prize. The film is a psychological thriller loosely based on the comic book series. Some commenters voiced concerns that it may cause harm by depicting the protagonist in a sympathetic way and including graphic and realistic violence. However, the creative team behind it said their work is meant for mature audiences who are expected to be able to tell right from wrong.
Midway Broadcasting announced today that its Chairwoman, Melody Spann Cooper is set to release her highly anticipated book to help female entrepreneurs and executives thrive in business. "The Girlfriend's Guide To Closing the Deal" shares insights on how women can use their voice to achieve equity at the negotiating table and advance their careers by using the female edition of the old-boy's network.
Throughout the book, Spann Cooper uses anecdotal references to deal with challenging issues including the #MeToo movement and Hillary Clinton's Presidential defeat and its impact on fueling the female empowerment in America.
The self-published book is the result of a groundbreaking self-entitled speech that Spann Cooper delivered as a keynote address at The National Association of Women Business Owners Conference in Chicago in 2017. The Girlfriend's Guide to Closing The Deal is written in a down-to-earth style that every "girlfriend" can relate.
Christie Hefner, businesswoman and daughter of Playboy Founder, Hugh Hefner, says "The Girlfriend's Guide to Closing The Deal" is both highly entertaining and very helpful. Melody weaves together personal anecdotes, triumphs, and setbacks with useful lessons learned. From how to own your ideas in a meeting to when its time to "friend up," everyone can benefit from Melody's story."
As Chairman of Midway Broadcasting Corporation, she joined an elite list of America's female broadcast owners after purchasing the company's controlling interest in 1999. Midway Broadcasting Corporation is a best-in-class female and family-owned media boutique whose properties include radio and interactive platforms.
The book was co-written with T. Shawn Taylor, journalist, writer and founder of Tree Top Consulting, a full-service media consulting firm.
Romania Invests Billions in a Black Sea Military Base
Romania will spend 2.5 billion euros to modernize the Black Sea military base as part of counteracting Russia's growing presence in the region, according to The Times, quoted by the FOCUS News Agency. Mikhail Koglignichanu Airbase, located about 200 km. east of Bucharest, will be aligned with NATO standards, as evidenced by documents published by local news sites. Up to 10,000 NATO F-35 soldiers and aircraft can be accommodated there. It is planned to become a "mini-city" for the military with kindergartens, sports clubs and a hospital.
The base has already become a center of increased NATO activity in the Black Sea, which has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West. After Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began to increase its naval presence in the Black Sea, using the deep-sea base in Sevastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria. Russia is also hampering shipping in the region and last year captured three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait.
Romania and Bulgaria, located on the Black Sea coast, which in the past were allies of the USSR, have joined NATO and the EU since its collapse. In response to Russia's actions, they have asked the alliance to strengthen its presence in the region, writes The Times. In February, 500 US troops arrived at Romania's air base. An Eurofighter Typhoon fighter squadron of the British Air Force is stationed and deployed. Since April last year, these aircraft have repeatedly intercepted Russian fighter jets. Georgia, located on the eastern Black Sea coast, is also concerned about Russia's aspirations. It is not a member of the alliance, but is involved in NATO military exercises. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to Tbilisi in March that the alliance was "preparing" Georgia for accession. Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region and has been developing its engagement with the Union since 2014.
Ukraine, the "New Berlin Wall," Once Again Lies at the Center of Scandal
Mr. Poroshenko's eagerness to win over Mr. Trump and his growing fears that political rivals would thwart his re-election opened the way for Mr. Giuliani to press Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, who has since been fired, to help Mr. Trump's own re-election by investigating Joe Biden and his son.
How Mr. Poroshenko expected the Trump administration to help lift his sagging fortunes ahead of Ukraine's presidential election, held in two rounds in March and April this year, is unclear. He got trounced anyway, losing emphatically to Mr. Zelensky, whose own officials quickly became the Trump team's new targets in its drive to damage Mr. Biden.
While Democrats want Mr. Trump impeached over his dealings with Ukraine, the president and his allies have counterattacked with their own Ukraine-focused scandals. They have revived a debunked theory that the country colluded with the Clinton campaign to hurt Mr. Trump's chances in 2016 and asserted, with little evidence, that Mr. Biden used his position as vice president to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son.
Ukrainians, jaded after years of watching their own leaders trade the power and privileges of office for personal financial or political gain, have mostly shrugged off what, for Mr. Trump, is possibly the most serious scandal to buffet the White House since Watergate toppled President Richard Nixon in 1974.
That a country few Americans paid much attention to in the past now commands center stage in Washington has stirred mostly bemusement in Ukraine. Those feelings are also tinged with a touch of pride that, after centuries in the shadow of Russia, its giant neighbor to the north, the nation is no longer seen as a backwater but a pivot around which the fate of the world's most powerful country implausibly turns.
Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's foreign minister under Mr. Poroshenko, said in a caustic Twitter message this week that going down in history "as the country that led to the impeachment of the U.S. president" was "not a very fun prospect." But, he added, "Now everyone understands what we are capable of."
Brother Jailed For Life For Pakistan Social Media Star Qandeel Baloch's Honour Killing
Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was on Friday convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison in the patriarchal country's highest-profile "honour killing."
Baloch, who shot to fame for her risque selfies -- tame by Western standards, but considered provocative in deeply misogynistic Pakistan -- was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested. Days later he told a press conference that he had no remorse over what he did, saying that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour had been "intolerable."
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in a long-awaited verdict.
"Inshallah (God willing), he will be acquitted by a high court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai told AFP she had hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent. She was my daughter and he is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder made international headlines and reignited calls for action against an epidemic of so-called "honour killings," in which a victim -- usually a woman -- is murdered for flouting patriarchal social codes.
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for offences such as choosing their own husband or -- in Baloch's case -- bringing "shame" on their family by celebrating their sexuality.
The killings are usually carried out by a close relative. Under Pakistan's Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (retribution) law, they can then seek forgiveness from a victim's relatives.
Three months after Baloch's murder, parliament passed new legislation mandating life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether a murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the judge's discretion, meaning that killers can theoretically claim a different motive and still be pardoned.
In Baloch's case, her parents initially insisted their son would be given no absolution.
But, heartbroken at the thought of losing him also, they changed their minds and said they wanted him to be forgiven.
International revulsion at the killing had seen the Pakistani state take the unprecedented step of declaring itself an heir alongside the parents, however, forcing the case to move ahead.
Some of Baloch's better-known actions included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.
She attracted criticism and threats but was perceived by many, including young people, as breaking new ground in a country where presenting yourself as a Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, political act of women's empowerment.
The roots of "honour" killings lie in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent across South Asia and dictate the behaviour of women in particular, though men can be victims too.
Three Scottish students named among Europe's best
Three University of Dundee students have been named regional winners as top graduates in Europe.
The University of Dundee students were named as top graduates in their respective fields in Europe in the 2019 Global Undergraduate Awards, whilst five other students from the same university were praised by the judges.
Scott Sheldrick, who graduated in Molecular Genetics, won the Europe award for Life Sciences, Chester Cornford studied MSc Mental Health Nursing and was awarded the Nursing, Midwifery & Allied Healthcare prize, whilst Lola Knibb won the Visual Arts award.
Although all three made it through to the global final, they lost out in the final round to strong competition from some of the 3,500 entrants from across the world.
Professor Blair Grubb, Vice-Principal (Education) at the University, said: "To get to this stage, our students and graduates faced competition from peers attending some of the world's top universities.
"The Undergraduate Awards are fiercely contested by thousands of students around the world and it is a great reflection of the quality of our students, and the education they receive here, that Dundee is so strongly represented amongst the prize winners.
"I would like to offer my warmest congratulations to Scott, Chester and Lola on this fantastic achievement, alongside the other Dundee representatives who were highly commended."
Another five students were commended in the world's leading undergraduate awards programme, which recognises top work completed by undergraduates to share this with a global audience.
Included in the five praised students were Nicholas Gallagher and James Osbourne (both Life Sciences), Ferenc Kohsuke Ishikawa Gutai (Medicine), Caitlyn Scott (Anatomical Sciences) and Waco Yokoyama (Philosophy).
The competition further celebrates top undergraduate coursework and helps create collaborations between students and recent graduates worldwide.
Oldest galaxy protocluster forms 'queen's court'
Using the Subaru, Keck, and Gemini Telescopes, an international team of astronomers has discovered a collection of 12 galaxies which existed about 13.0 billion years ago. This is the earliest protocluster ever found. One of the 12 galaxies is a giant object, known as Himiko, which was discovered a decade ago by the Subaru Telescope and named for a mythological queen in ancient Japan. This discovery suggests that large structures such as protoclusters already existed when the Universe was only about 800 million years old, 6 percent of its present age.
In the present Universe, galaxy clusters can contain hundreds of members, but how these clusters form is a big question in astronomy. To understand the formation of clusters, astronomers search for possible progenitors in the ancient Universe. A protocluster is a dense system of dozens of galaxies in the early Universe, growing into a cluster.
Yuichi Harikane, a JSPS fellow at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan who led the team of astronomers explains, "A protocluster is a rare and special system with an extremely high density, and not easy to find. To overcome this problem, we used the wide field of view of the Subaru Telescope to map a large area of the sky and look for protoclusters."
In the map of the Universe made by the Subaru Telescope, the team discovered a protocluster candidate, z66OD, where galaxies are 15 times more concentrated than normal for that era. The team then conducted follow-up spectroscopic observations using the W.M. Keck Observatory and Gemini North telescope, and confirmed 12 galaxies which existed 13.0 billion years ago, making it the earliest protocluster known to date.
Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in z66OD was a giant object with a huge body of gas, known as Himiko, which was found previously by the Subaru Telescope in 2009. "It is reasonable to find a protocluster near a massive object, such as Himiko. However, we're surprised to see that Himiko was located not in the center of the protocluster, but on the edge 500 million light-years away from the center." said Masami Ouchi, a team member at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo, who discovered Himiko in 2009. Ironically, the mythological queen Himiko is also said to have lived cloistered away from her people. Ouchi continues, "It is still not understood why Himiko is not located in the center. These results will be a key for understanding the relationship between clusters and massive galaxies."
Nancy Pelosi is subject of book by daughter Christine Pelosi
An upcoming book on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi comes from someone who knows her well, daughter Christine Pelosi.
"The Nancy Pelosi Way" will be released Nov. 26, Skyhorse Publishing announced Thursday. Christine Pelosi's book will examine how a mother of five became the first female house speaker and her current leadership of House Democrats during the Trump administration. According to Skyhorse, Christine Pelosi will weave together "the professional and personal experiences" of her mother.
Christine Pelosi is a Democratic Party strategist and author of "Campaign Boot Camp" and "Campaign Boot Camp 2.0." Pelosi's sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has made several documentaries about contemporary politics.
Warren's lemonade money went to a pro-life charity
When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) purchased drinks from two girls running a lemonade stand in August, she may not have been aware that her $10 purchase would be donated to a pro-life charity.
"Our daughters thought [Warren] was nice," Dan Michels, a Trump supporter and a father to one of the girls, told the Washington Free Beacon. "She came by and told us we should vote for her. And our daughters told us she was a nice person, but we don't align with her politically and ... because she's pro-choice, we said we should donate her money to a pro-life [cause]."
On August 8, Warren stopped by a lemonade stand staffed by two 11-year-old children, Sienna Michels and Audrey Billings, during a campaign bus tour across Iowa.
"Stopped for a quick drink at a lemonade stand in Harlan, Iowa. When life gives you lemons, make big structural change!" Warren said on Twitter.
The two kids were excited about meeting a presidential candidate in person. The Michels girl urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020 after the photo op. The parents instead explained Warren's stance on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, a non-profit that supports pro-life legislation.
"My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her," Michels said. "We talked about the abortion part of things and said maybe we should donate money to stop abortion, and my daughter was all for that."
Why viruses like Herpes and Zika will need to be reclassified: Biotech impact
New research reveals that the way viruses were perceived in terms of their architecture will need to be retooled, because they are actually structured in many more patterns than previously understood. The findings could have significant impact on how they are classified, our understanding of how they form, evolve and infect hosts, and strategies to identify ways to design vaccines to target them.
In the 1950s and '60s as scientists began to obtain high resolution images of viruses, they discovered the detailed structure of the capsid -- an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein -- which protects the virus' genetic material. The majority of viruses have capsids that are typically quasi-spherical and display icosahedral symmetry -- like a 20-sided dice for instance.
The capsid shell is what protects them, and as scientists discovered their structure, they proposed that capsids could have different sizes and hold different amounts of genome, and therefore could infect hosts differently.
Why this matters
When designing drugs to target viruses, scientists can now take their varying structural shapes into account to improve efficacy.
Two researchers who study the structures of viruses, Antoni Luque, a theoretical biophysicist at San Diego State University and a member of its Viral Information Institute, and Reidun Twarock, a mathematical biologist from the University of York, UK, and a member of York's Cross-disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis, show that many viruses have essentially been misclassified for 60 years, including common viruses such as Herpes simplex and Zika.
This was because despite having the structural images from cryo-electron microscopy, we did not have the mathematical description of many of the architectures of different viruses.
"We discovered six new ways in which proteins can organize to form icosahedral capsid shells," Luque said. "So, many viruses don't adopt only the two broadly understood capsid architectures. There are now at least eight ways in which their icosahedral capsids could be designed."
They used a generalization of the quasiequivalence principle to see how proteins can wrap around an icosahedral capsid.
Their study, which will be published in Nature Communications on Friday, September 27, also shows that viruses that are part of the same structural lineage, based on the protein that they're composed of, adopt consistent icosahedral capsid layouts, providing a new approach to study virus evolution.
Biotech applications
Structural biologists can now take this information and reclassify the structure of the viruses, which will help unveil molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.
It will also provide a guide to engineer new molecular containers for nanotech and biotech applications, and it will help scientists to identify specific strategies to target the assembly of proteins in the capsid. This can eventually lead to a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.
"We can use this discovery to target both the assembly and stability of the capsid, to either prevent the formation of the virus when it infects the host cell, or break it apart after it's formed," Luque said. "This could facilitate the characterization and identification of antiviral targets for viruses sharing the same icosahedral layout."
This new framework accommodates viruses that were previously outliers, provides new predictions of viral capsid architectures, and has identified common geometrical patterns among distant evolutionary related viruses that infect everyone from humans to bacteria.
Twarock said the new blueprints also provide "a new perspective on viral evolution, suggesting novel routes in which larger and more complex viruses may have evolved from simple ones at evolutionary timescales."
Architectural applications
The geometries could be also used in new architectural designs in buildings and construction.
Since the 1960s, these viral capsids have been classified using the geometrical framework introduced by structural biologist Donald Caspar and biophysicist Aaron Klug, which were inspired by the geodesic domes designed by the renowned architect R. Buckminster Fuller. However, as molecular imaging techniques have advanced, an increasing number of 3D viral capsid reconstructions that included viruses like Herpes or Zika have fallen out from this classical geometrical framework.
"This study introduces a more general framework than the classic Caspar-Klug construction. It is based on the conservation of the local vertices formed by the proteins that interact in the capsid," Luque explained. "This approach led to the discovery of six new types of icosahedral capsid layouts, while recovering the two classical layouts from Caspar-Klug based on Goldberg and geodesic polyhedra."
Priest who sexually abused boys in Wisconsin gets 30 years
A former priest accused of sexually assaulting young boys in Wisconsin decades ago has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.
The Wausau Daily Herald reports that 72-year-old Thomas Ericksen received the maximum sentence Thursday on two charges of sexually assaulting young boys while stationed at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Winter in the late 70s and early 80s. He must register as a sex offender for life.
Four men testified Thursday about how the assaults affected their lives. One of the victims went public for the first time.
Ericksen apologized to the victims in court and said he has come to realize the impact the assaults had on victims. At least 11 men claim they were abused by Ericksen during his time in the clergy.
Ericksen was removed from the priesthood in 1988.
Having Too Much Of This Spice Could Damage Liver
Made from the inner bark of the Cinnamomum tree, cinnamon is a widely popular spice, earning itself a place in a large variety of food and even becoming a flavor itself.
And all for good reason since the spice is host to some very impressive health benefits, such as lowering the risk of life-threatening diseases like heart disease, cancer and even diabetes.
But hold your horses just yet since too much of a good thing can be harmful, very harmful. And in this case, here are some side effects one can get if they eat too much cinnamon. Stay safe out there.
May increase the risk of cancer - Unfortunately, while cinnamon can help lower the risk of cancer, it can also very much contribute to the development of it. Per animal studies, consuming too much coumarin, which is commonly found in Cassia cinnamon, may increase the risk of cancer development. Per scientists, coumarin does this by supposedly damaging our DNAs over time.
May cause liver damage - Per studies, too much coumarin can also be responsible for liver toxicity and damage. This is according to several studies made on the effects of too much coumarin in our bodies.
May cause mouth sores - Not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth sores. This is supposedly because cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, which is a compound that when ingested in large amounts, can cause an allergic reaction in our bodies. However, one can only get mouth sores from cinnamaldehyde when they're allergic from it.
May cause breathing problems - This is more of a general precaution since cinnamon's fine texture makes it very easy to inhale that may cause coughing and gagging as well as the cinnamaldehyde in it acting as a throat irritant.
May cause low blood sugar - For many people, cinnamon is helpful since it's well known for having the ability to lower our blood sugar. This is good, especially for those who suffer from high blood sugar. However, too many of it can make our blood sugar fall too low, posing a new set of health risks.
Tennessee's abortion waiting period trial goes to judge
A federal judge will have to decide which experts to believe in a trial over Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period law for abortions.
Over the course of a four-day trial in Nashville that concluded Thursday, the state tried to show that the law, which requires women to make two separate trips to a clinic at least 48 hours apart, benefits women by allowing them time to reflect on their decisions. Attorneys representing five of the state's seven abortion clinics argued the law provides no benefits and causes significant burdens.
Experts for both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions are uncertain, and some women who go through with an abortion later regret their decision. But they differed on whether those constituted a large or small percentage of the women seeking abortions. The experts also disagreed on whether Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period would make any difference for those women.
On Thursday, attorneys for the state introduced a study from Utah on the effects of a 72-hour waiting period there. It found that 8% of participating women who attended an initial counselling visit later said they were no longer seeking an abortion.
Questioned about the study, Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher at the University of California San Francisco, agreed that some women change their minds about having an abortion or are uncertain to begin with. But she noted that the study did not find that Utah's mandatory waiting period caused women to change their minds or that it was otherwise beneficial to women.
Biggs also testified that there is no evidence that abortion causes women to have mental health problems. She said a national study comparing women seeking abortions who were just under the cutoff date to obtain them with a group of women who were over the cutoff and were turned away from clinics found no difference in the rates of issues like depression and post-traumatic stress.
Under cross-examination Biggs said the study did not follow the mental health outcomes of women in states with waiting periods who changed their minds about having an abortion, although there were only three women like that identified in the study. She rebutted testimony from earlier in the week by Priscilla Coleman, a psychology professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who said that abortion is associated with mental health problems.
Coleman testified that she believes most of the scientific literature on abortion is politically biased in favor of abortions.
Thursday also included testimony for the state from a Memphis obstetrician and gynecologist who participates in a controversial network that attempts to halt the effects of abortion-inducing medication. Dr. Michael Podraza said that through that work he has "personal experience with women who have changed their minds about an abortion."
Tennessee's waiting period law went into effect in mid-2015, and Podraza said he has seen several women since then who wanted to try to reverse a medical abortion that was already underway. Some of those women then changed their minds a second time and followed through with the abortion, he testified. These reversals happened in spite of the waiting period.
Clinic directors previously testified the wait period causes women financial hardship and stress. They also said the two-visit requirement poses logistical challenges for patients and clinics that cause abortions to be delayed far beyond the 48 hours required by law, pushing some women into surgical abortions, which have greater risks of complications. A few women are pushed beyond the time when they can receive an abortion altogether.
Tennessee is one of 14 states with laws requiring women to make two trips to an abortion clinic according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.
In determining whether Tennessee's waiting period violates the U.S. Constitution, U.S. District Judge Bernard Freidman must determine whether it places an undue burden on women seeking abortion. It's a subjective standard that has caused some waiting period laws to be struck down and others upheld, depending on the specific circumstances of the state.
After both sides rested their cases on Thursday, Friedman said he would rule as quickly as possible.
French chemical fire extinguished as questions mount
French authorities and Normandy residents are clearing up residue from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul stench continues to spread over a swath of territory.
No one was injured in Thursday's fire at a lubricant plant in Rouen, but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby Seine River.
The head of the regional administration said Friday the fire was extinguished Thursday night after nearly 24 hours. Firefighters are still on the scene.
The administration warned of a new odor released after the fire was put out, saying it could spread to neighboring regions.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said people in fragile health should remain indoors through Friday night.
The cause of the fire is being investigated. The plant is among the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
LNG investments hit record in 2019 & the biggest growth is coming from China
Investments in liquefied natural gas since the start of the year have hit an all-time high of $50 billion, the International Energy Agency's head, Fatih Birol, told an industry conference.
"This year, 2019 already broke the highest amount of (final investment decisions) for the first time ever, $50 billion," Birol told the LNG Producer-Consumer conference in Tokyo, as quoted by Reuters.
Unsurprisingly, the driver of this growth in investments is growing demand for the fuel in Asia, with China still expected to overtake Japan as the world's top importer of LNG.
"The biggest growth is coming from China. In the next five years, about one-third of global LNG demand will come from China alone," Birol said. He added that in five years, China will become the largest importer of the fuel.
As for the growth in investments, there are no surprises there, either. The bulk of these has been made in the United States and Canada.
In a December 2018 report the Energy Information Administration said it expected the United States" LNG export capacity to double by the end of this year to 8.9 billion cu ft daily. This will make the US the third-largest exporter of LNG in terms of capacity after Qatar and Australia. By 2030, US LNG exports are estimated to reach 17 billion cu ft daily, from some 3 billion cu ft at the start of 2019.
In Canada, there is just one LNG project under development right now - LNG Canada - but it could have a final capacity of 28 million tons of the fuel annually. The US$31-billion project is led by Shell, with minority participants including Petronas, PetroChina, Mitsubishi, and Kogas.
Meanwhile, Qatar is stepping up its efforts to keep its number-one spot in the global LNG export race. The country has lifted a moratorium on new drilling in its North Field - the world's largest offshore gas field Qatar shares with Iran - aiming to boost export capacity by 43 percent to 11 million tons annually.
Global LNG demand is seen at 550 million tons by 2030, according to projections by IHS Markit.
Viola Davis Drops Some Truth Bombs About Playing Michelle Obama On 'Jimmy Kimmel'
Viola Davis is feeling the pressure of playing Michelle Obama.
"I'm terrified," the actor said on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" Thursday.
It was announced last month that Davis would star as the former first lady in Showtime's dramatized "First Ladies" anthology series. Davis said the script is great, but she's keenly aware of the burden to get her performance right.
"I don't care what else I've done in my life ― I won an Emmy, I won an Oscar, two Tonys ― but if I mess this up, this'll be the defining moment in my life," she told host Kimmel.
Davis said she's waiting for her publicist "to call and say, "Hold the line, it's Michelle Obama ― to cuss your ass out.""
Davis, in her sixth and final season of "How To Get Away With Murder," is also thinking of the audience.
"Listen, I don't want to make my people mad," she said.
Judge shows concern for violent teen's choice of drink on attack night
A judge sentencing a teenager for a violent attack on a love rival appeared to show just as much concern about his choice of drink in the lead up to it.
Kieran Clifton, 19, battered a 17-year-old he blamed for the end of his relationship with a former girlfriend.
Oxford Crown Court heard Clifton had been drinking mixers at the Fat Fox pub in Watlington, Oxfordshire, shortly before the assault in March last year.
Judge Nigel Daly told Clifton, who admitted ABH, that the alcohol had "played a significant part" in the night's violence.
But he remarked of Clifton's choice of tipple: "Drinking Coca Cola and Amaretto? I'm surprised you were not sick!"
Clifton, from Chalgrove, was handed a 12-month sentence, suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete a 15-day rehabilitation activity requirement along with 160 hours" unpaid work and pay £750 compensation.
'It sounds dorky, but it's really fun': inside the cosy world of bookstagram
A pink blanket goes with everything: Jane Austen classics, a queer young-adult romcom, fantasy novel Six of Crows. Jordan Hickey's version is crocheted, made by her grandmother, and appears in most photos on her Instagram account pagetravels, where it's paired with various books to evoke a sense of tantalizing coziness. Wouldn't you like to be here right now, her photos imply, cuddled up with this blanket and this mug of coffee, with nothing else on your to-do list aside from reading the new novel Frankly In Love, out today?
Hickey is a part of "bookstagram," the corner of Instagram combining a love of books with stylized, eye-catching photos, to the delight of large fanbases. The bookstagram tag has been used on over 35m Instagram posts, and the more popular bookstrammers have upwards of 100,000 followers (for comparison, the Instagram for the New York Times book section has about 69,000 followers.) There are enough people joining bookstagram that a slew of articles have cropped up, advising would-be bookstagrammers on best practice, how to manage Instagram's "pesky algorithm" and the best budget-friendly props. Some accounts focus on old books, or books by authors of color, many play with elaborate staging.
Leader of Colombia's Los Pelusos crime gang killed, president says
The top leader and founder of Colombia's Los Pelusos crime gang has been killed in an operation led by the national police, President Ivan Duque said on Friday.
The gang is one of the most well-known criminal organizations in the Andean country and involved in fighting that has endangered hundreds of thousands of people in areas along the eastern border with Venezuela.
Luis Antonio Quintero, known by his alias Pacora, was a former leftist rebel who commanded some 440 gang members, the government said.
The 49-year-old was wanted on terrorism and murder charges and located in Norte de Santander province on Thursday.
"It's clear we are going to completely break up this group," Duque said in a statement from the United States, where he traveled for the United Nations General Assembly this week.
Quintero was responsible for the killings of human rights activists and community leaders, the statement added.
Duque has faced criticism from some in the international community for not doing more to stop killings of activists from being committed with impunity across the country.
Another leader of Los Pelusos was captured in the operation, the statement added. It did not provide details about the circumstances of Quintero's death.
'How dare you?' Thunberg's U.N. speech inspires Dutch climate protesters
Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders "how dare you?" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.

Turnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000. Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.
Thunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.
"This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life," said protester Reinder Rustema.
Banging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city center with placards reading: "For the Greta good," "Don't be a fossil fool," and "You will die of old age, we will die of climate change."
"I understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests. "We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems. But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs."
Thunberg's brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.
"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?" she said, her voice quavering with emotion.
The Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.
The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.
Thunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets.
Military Sees Frustrating Trend As Suicides Spike
Military suicides surged this year to a record high among active duty troops, continuing a deadly trend that Pentagon officials say is frustrating and they are struggling to counter.
The Army, Navy and Marine Corps all saw the rate of suicides go up as well as the overall numbers, with only the Air Force showing a decrease, according to data released by the Pentagon Thursday. Suicides among members of the Reserves and the National Guard also grew.
The difficulties involved in identifying service members with possible problems and finding ways to prevent suicides were underscored earlier this month when the Navy reported that three crew members who served on the USS George H.W. Bush took their own lives within a week.
Asked about the deaths in the crew of the aircraft carrier, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, "I wish I could tell you we have an answer to prevent further, future suicides in the Armed Services. We don't. We are caught up in what some call a national epidemic of suicide among our youth."
The number of suicides across the military increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the most at-risk population is young enlisted men, and at least 60 percent of the time they chose a gun as their suicide method. Army suicides went from 114 to 139, while the Marines went from 43 to 58 and the Navy went from 65 to 68. The Air Force dipped from 63 to 60.
"Our numbers are not moving in the right direction," said Elizabeth Van Winkle, director of the Pentagon's office of force resiliency. She said that most of the military rates are comparable to civilians, but added, "that's hardly comforting."
Military and defense leaders expressed dismay and a resolve to do more to increase resilience in the force, train service members how to handle stress better and encourage troops to seek help when they need it. Van Winkle said the military is also looking at increasing efforts to train troops on the safe storage of firearms and medication. She said there are no consistent rules or regulations across the department and the services requiring gun locks or other controls on firearms, but that some states or bases have their own restrictions.
She and Karen Orvis, director of the suicide prevention office, said recognizing service members who may be struggling or at risk of taking their own lives is very difficult, and that sometimes suicide is a sudden, impulsive decision with little warning. They said it's difficult to identify reasons for suicide because there are so many stresses that could contribute.
They also acknowledged that service members are reluctant to come forward and seek help, because they worry that it could affect promotions or security clearances. And military leaders said they must all work harder to address those perceived roadblocks.
"Just as we talk about physical fitness, marksmanship, training and education, Marines must also be comfortable discussing life's struggles, mental wellness and suicide," said Gen. David Berger, commandant of the Marine Corps. "We must create a community where seeking help and assistance are simply normal, important decisions Marines and sailors make."
This year for the first time, the Pentagon included statistics for suicides by military spouses and dependents. Van Winkle said the most recent numbers available were for 2017, but officials are working to get better at collecting family data.
According to the report, there were 186 families that had suicides - 123 were spouses and 63 were dependents between the ages of 12 and 23.
The vast majority - nearly 70 percent - were female spouses under the age of 40, while 70 percent of the dependent suicides were males. About half of the dependents who died by suicide were at least 18 years old and, for those younger than that, most of the deaths were youth between 15 and 17.
Seth Meyers Loses It Laughing During Donald Trump 'Tango & Cash' Impression
"Late Night" host Seth Meyers on Thursday brought a moment of levity to an otherwise strained week marred by mass shootings when he cracked a gag about President Donald Trump and then couldn't stop laughing.
The comedian noted how Trump had visited the El Paso, Texas, hospital where victims of the weekend's mass shooting are being treated while his campaign still owed the city more than half a million dollars for a political rally in February.
The campaign also incurred a one-time late fee over its failure to pay on time.
"That's so him," said Meyers. "I'm surprised his Oval Office desk isn't covered in unreturned Blockbuster DVDs."
He then began mimicking Trump with a riff on hit 1989 movie "Tango & Cash," but soon descended into a fit of the giggles.
Man gets prison after woman finds bullet in her skull
A Georgia man has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend, who didn't realize she survived a bullet to the brain until she went to the hospital for treatment of headaches.
News outlets report 39-year-old Jerrontae Cain was sentenced Thursday on charges including being a felon in possession of a gun in the 2017 attack on 42-year-old Nicole Gordon.
Suffering from severe headaches and memory loss, Gordon was examined last year by doctors who found a bullet lodged in her skull.
Gordon told police she didn't remember being shot, but did remember an argument with Cain during which her car window shattered and she passed out. She thought she was hurt by broken glass, and she was patched up at the home of Cain's mother.
This Model's Runway Stomp Has Eclipsed All Else At Paris Fashion Week
As Lady Gaga once sang in her 2008 hit "Bad Romance": "Walk, walk, fashion, baby."
One model took those words to heart and "murdered" the runway, according to one editor, while closing Maison Margiela's spring 2020 collection by John Galliano at Paris Fashion Week on Wednesday.
Model Leon Dame, 20, strutted down the catwalk like no one has strutted before, powerfully putting one foot in front of the other and stomping down the runway, while keeping an intense, steely glare intact.
His walk, paired with his belted top, white shorts, knee-high boots and cadet hat, quickly took the internet by storm. In one video of his walk, it appears he even got a smile out of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour as he passed by her.
Many praised the young German model, who has appeared in campaigns for Jil Sander, Fay and Solid Homme, for his distinctive swagger.
Actor and "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Lisa Rinna described Leon as her "spirit animal," and fashion designer and singer Rihanna followed him on Instagram.
"This video and this exit take the cake," one fan wrote on Leon's page after the model posted a video of his walk. "Crushhh leon" another added, while makeup artist and mogul Pat McGrath ― who did the makeup for the show ― left him lightning and fire emojis.
Perhaps the highest praise came from Tim Blanks, editor-at-large of the fashion site The Business of Fashion.
"You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!" Blanks wrote in an Instagram caption on Wednesday, quoting the film "42nd Street."
He added, "@leondame MURDERED the catwalk @maisonmargiela. Guess it's true what they say. There ain't nothin" like a DAME!"
Geomagnetic Storm in the Last days of September
Geomagnetic disturbances are expected from September 27 to September 29, according to the US National Atmospheric and Oceanic Research Agency's Space Weather Forecast Center. Moderate geomagnetic storm (G2) is possible due to high-speed solar wind
The Russian Laboratory for Solar Activity Research at the Lebedev Institute predicts that the disturbance will start in the evening of September 27, and culminate in the next day from morning until noon. The planetary index can jump to 5 Kp level.
Geomagnetic storms can affect people with problems in the cardiovascular system. Doctors warn that some people may develop heart cramps, dizziness, headache and lack of concentration. Magnetic disturbances often affect people with mental disorders as well.
In case of more severe disturbances, there are also fluctuations in the electricity grid. Satellites providing navigation information are also vulnerable.
The beautiful side of such phenomena are the spectacular Northern Lights in the sky above the poles.
Sony, Disney Back To Work On Third Spider-Man Film
Looks like there will be a homecoming of sorts for Spider-Man, now that Disney and Sony have settled their differences.
The two studios announced on Friday that they will collaborate on a third Spider-Man film starring Tom Holland.
The as yet untitled film will be released on July 16, 2021, and be produced by the Disney-owned Marvel Studios and its president, Kevin Feige, according to a press release sent by both studios.
Amy Pascal will also produce through Pascal Pictures, as she has on the first two Holland-led films, the release said.
"I am thrilled that Spidey's journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it," Feige said in the release. "Spider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe."
The agreement also allows Spidey to appear in a future Marvel Studios film.
Feige acknowledged the collaboration makes the webslinger unique among superheroes.
"[Spider-Man] happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold," he said.
The end to the Spidey standoff came more than a month after it was reported the two studios were unable to reach terms on a deal for a sequel to their previous films, "Homecoming" and "Far From Home."
The sticking point was that Disney ― which owns the character ― reportedly wanted a co-financing stake in future films with Sony, which has the film rights thanks to deals set up before the Mouse bought Marvel in 2009.
The Hollywood Reporter notes both sides had good reason to come together. "Far From Home" is Sony's biggest box office hit ever, while Marvel gets to maximize merchandising and keep creative control.
One person who was happy the impasse has ended was Holland himself, who expressed his joy on Instagram.
EU, British negotiators work toward Brexit deal in Belgium
The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator began talks With British officials in Belgium Friday to work toward an agreement, with about a month remaining before the departure deadline.
Michel Barnier met with Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay in Brussels, who was adamant the Irish "backstop" be stripped from any deal. The backstop, effectively an assurance of a soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Britain leaves, has been perhaps the chief obstacle in negotiations.
While Barclay said Britain is committed to finding a deal, he said there isn't much time left.
"I think there is still a long way to go. I think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations," he said.
The deadline to leave the EU is Oct. 31, but a new British law prevents Prime Minister Boris Johnson from completing the withdrawal without a trade agreement, or Parliament's approval to leave without one by Oct. 19.
Last week, EU negotiators said they are open to an alternative to the backstop -- but Irish deputy Simon Coveney said Friday London hasn't yet submitted a "serious" proposal.
"Until there is a serious proposal, which can be the basis of negotiations, then the gaps which are wide at the moment will remain," he said.
He added that "time is running out" and "the onus is on the British prime minister and his team" to put serious proposals on the table.
Johnson's office said Friday there are still "significant obstacles" to a deal.
"From an Irish perspective, we of course think that an extension is preferable to a no-deal," Coveney said. "But I think there would have to be good reason behind that to ask for an extension."
EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said he and Barnier are doing everything they can for a deal and if they fail, it's Britain's fault.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he's not optimistic about a deal, but urged British leaders to present a plan at a Brexit summit on Oct. 17.
"The withdrawal agreement is actually an international treaty," he said. "It's not the kind of thing that can be amended or cobbled together late at night."
Scientists puzzled by really big planet orbiting really little star
Scientists are expressing surprise after discovering a solar system 30 light-years away from Earth that defies current understanding about planet formation, with a large Jupiter-like planet orbiting a diminutive star known as a red dwarf.
An artistic impression of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting its red dwarf host star, released on September 26, 2019.
Stars generally are much bigger than even the largest planets that orbit them. But in this case, the star and the planet are not much different in size, the researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ 3512, is about 12% the size of our sun, while the planet that orbits it has a mass of at least about half of Jupiter, our solar system's largest planet.
"Yes, an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia at the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, who led the research published in the journal Science.
"The discovery was surprising because theoretical formation models suggest that low-mass stars typically host small planets, similar to Earth or small Neptunes. In this case, we have found a gas giant planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, which like Jupiter is composed mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. It travels around its star in a very elliptical orbit lasting 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small, with relatively low surface temperatures. GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, it is somewhat comparable in size to a very large planet, being only about 35% bigger than Jupiter.
"They emit less energy, so they are fainter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather cool, below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 Celsius) approximately. This is why the have a reddish color," Morales said.
There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting the star, while a third planet might have been ejected from the star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.
Planets are born from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that produces the star around which they orbit. Under the leading model for planetary formation, called the "core accretion" model, an object initially forms from solid particles in the disk and the gravitational tug of this embryonic planet allows for an atmosphere to arise from the surrounding gas.
A competing model, called the gravitational instability model, may explain this unusual system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be slightly more massive than expected and cold," Morales said. "This makes the disk become unstable so some dense regions can appear. These clumps can grow until they collapse, forming a planet."
School strikers around the world march to demand action on climate
Children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change Friday, in their first major action since the issue topped world leader's agenda at the United Nations this week.
The Fridays for Future movement that began as a lone demonstration by Swedish teen Greta Thunbergjust over a year ago has mushroomed, with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New Yorkand attracting attention in developing nations across Africa.
Some of the first protests began in New Zealand, where Thunberg saidorganizers estimated 170,000 people marched across the country. There were also marches in cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India, among other countries.
Friday's protest followed a week of climate talks at the United Nations in New York, which included a scathing speech by Thunbergto world leaders reprimanding them for inaction.
"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words," she said on Tuesday. "The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you."
Citing a U.N.-backed reportreleased last year, demonstrators are demanding governments implement measures to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees, which scientists warn result in dire consequences for human life and the planet.
Thunberg and the young people she has inspired say they will not stop their weekly classroom walkouts until they see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.
In Nigeria's capital Abuja, Oladosu Adenike marked her 46th consecutive strike on Friday. The activist posted images on Twitter of students dressed in blue school uniforms carrying banners with messages, "Climate change is real" and "We don't have time."
In Lausanne, Switzerland, where hundreds of climate strike organizers gatheredin August planning for this week's events, thousands of people marched through the city, according to local reports.
Thousands more were expected to take to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, where local media reportedthat the city's school would allow students to participate.
Thunberg, who remains in North America following her visit to the U.N., was scheduled to participate in climate strikes in Montreal, Canada.
Serena Williams Fined $10,000 For Allegedly Damaging Wimbledon Court
Serena Williams, tennis legend and seven-time Wimbledon champion, is being fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging the London practice courts with her racquet.
The All England Club, which hosts the Wimbledon tournament, handed the fine to Williams after she reportedly caused damage during a practice round on the outside courts on June 30, according to The Associated Press and CNN.
The 37-year-old tennis star appeared to shrug off the fine while speaking to reporters after winning the quarterfinal round against Alison Riske on Tuesday.
"I haven't really thought about it, to be honest," she said when asked about the fine. "I just threw my racquet. I got fined."
Williams said she didn't know how that could've caused damage.
"I mean, I guess if you could tell me, I would appreciate it," she told reporters. "I mean, I have always been an Avenger in my heart. Maybe I'm super strong. I don't know."
Williams is after her eighth Wimbledon title, which would be her 24th grand slam victory. She is advancing to the singles semifinals on Thursday against Czech player Barbora Strýcová.
Williams was also fined a total of $17,000 last year after she defended herself against an umpire at the U.S. Open who accused her of illegally communicating with her coach during a match.
During that incident, the umpire issued three code violations to Williams: One for receiving illegal coaching, a second for breaking her tennis racket in frustration and a third after she confronted the umpire and called him a "thief."
Many of Williams" fans claimed that the umpire was unnecessarily harsh in his response to her, especially considering male players" meltdowns throughout the history of the sport.
"Do you know how many other men do things that are much worse than that?" Williams told U.S. Open officials who entered the court during the match after her confrontation with the umpire.
Williams wasn't the only one who received a fine at this year's Wimbledon, though hers was the most costly.
Italian player Fabio Fognini was fined $3,000 for saying a "bomb should explode" at the tennis courts after he lost the third round to U.S. player Tennys Sandgren on Saturday.
Nick Kyrgios of Australia was hit with two fines ― one for $3,000 and a second for $5,000 ― for unsportsmanlike conduct.
The Who STOP concert last night: Friday and Sunday shows CANCELLED
Rock legends The Who are on a major US tour. In Houston, Texas, Roger Daltrey was forced to call off the concert less than halfway through. The 75-year-old told the disappointed audience: "I think I should quit while I'm ahead." The band had performed eight songs already but promised to try and return for another show one day in the future. Watch the video of how it all unfolded on stage.
After playing classic 1982 track Eminence Front, Daltrey called it quits. he has struggled with vocal issues and apparently is under strict instructions from his surgeon.
The British star told the crowd he couldn't go on with the show: "If I carry on trying to do what I'm doing for you, I'm going to damage myself. I think I should quit while I'm ahead... Last time, I ended up in hospital for a month and I'm not going there again. Sorry."
Pete Townshend explained what was going on to the audience: "It sounds like he cannot do any more, I'm afraid..."
The band left the stage, originally suggesting they would try to work out the rest of the set without Roger.
When he returned, Townsend said: "I'm really, really sorry. Roger cannot actually speak now.
"Apparently, before the show, he saw a doctor, and you know, he's been singing so f***ing great through this tour. I don't know what the f*** is going on. He has been on top of his game.
"I'm really sorry this has happened to you guys tonight... I don't think there is much point trying to put anything together that makes any sense because this is Roger's show and he's not in good shape."
The crowd was completely supportive, cheering the 74-year-old as he explained what had happened and how the band hoped to return to honour their commitment to the show.
Townsend said; "We will publish a date for our return as soon as we can. Let me explain one thing... We only do one day on, one day off. This is because Roger's vocal surgeon insists he has a day off...
"I swear to you we will come back and we will honour your tickets. I love you so much and I'm sorry to let you down."
Following the show, the upcoming Friday and Sunday night concerts in Dallas and Denver were cancelled.
Their next show is on October 9 in San Francisco. The band will open their UK tour in Manchester n March 16, 2020.
Michael Schumacher's Manager with a Statement about his Condition
An official statement was released regarding Michael Schumacher's health. The legend has been recovering for almost 6 years from injuries sustained after a skiing accident in the Alps in 2013, Gong.bg reported.
Weeks ago, worldwide media reported that the former pilot had been admitted for treatment at a hospital in Paris. Sabine Kehm, Schumi's long-time manager and longtime family friend of the Schumacher family, made the statement.
"Michael's health is not a public issue, so we will not comment on it, if only because we need to protect Michael's privacy as much as possible," Kehm stated. "We realise that this is difficult for some people to understand, but we do so in perfect accordance with Michael's attitude and can only thank you for being understanding,"
She also revealed that Schumacher is an extremely sensitive person. He did not like his name to be in the headlines and avoided public appearances even before the incident.
The manager urged not to believe in any photos that "leak" on social networks and in yellow magazines around the world.
Authorities Investigating Deadly Crash In Angeles National Forest, Body Found
Police were investigating a deadly crash in the Angeles National Forest Thursday afternoon.
According to police, a body was found inside of a vehicle just below the Angeles Forest Highway and Big Tujunga Canyon Road.
Initial reports from the scene said that the vehicle might have been there for some time.
It was not immediately clear how the vehicle was found.
Are hopes for a nuclear-free world realistic?
Seventy-four years ago, two nuclear bombs were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing tens of thousands of people.
Since then, wherever conflict between major powers rises, so does the threat of a nuclear war.
Various treaties have attempted to suppress that threat, yet today there are nearly 14,000 nuclear weapons based around the world.
Thursday marks the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but it's a goal that looks increasingly less likely.
So, is there the political will to abolish these weapons?
Meghan to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and refuses let own needs 'fade away' amid her royal duties
Meghan Markle is determined to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and not let her own needs 'fade away' now she's a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls.
The Duchess of Sussex, 38, reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry.
Woodstock Exchange, the UK-SA Tech Hub, focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs, particularly women, to acquire skills, resources and support.
The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress, 38, meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology, conservation and fashion and praise them for 'empowering the next generation' of creative minds.
During a conversation with the female tech founders Meghan, who has campaigned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls, said she hopes to do the same for young men.
Mother-of-two Naadiya Moosajee, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of Women in Engineering, revealed: 'We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well,' People reports.
'We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons, but generally in public too.'
She added that having Meghan present 'didn't feel hierarchical', as it was 'women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have, as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies'.
Matsi Modise, founder of skills training company Simodisa, said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the Fold.
'She talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can't just fade away now that you're a duchess,' Modise recalled.
'That you have to be true to who you are.'
She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.
'She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,' Modise added, admitting she felt a bit 'awestruck' by Meghan.
'She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,' Modise said.
'A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting. She made it easy. She is an easy-going royal.'
Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie 'a lot' but 'all so exciting'.
Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: 'We're only five months in right now. Being a working mum and travelling as well with a baby, my goodness it's a lot, but it's all so exciting.
'There are days when it's a lot to juggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say "ah-ha," and it's so rewarding.'
Meghan then went to the city's Mothers2Mothers organisation, which trains and employs women with HIV.
She took along some of Archie's baby clothes, including a onesie saying 'The Future' and his Invictus babygro which he no longer fits, alongside donations from her friends with children.
Parents of 5-month-old stuffed in suitcase and tossed in dumpster get 6 years in prison
The parents of a 5½-month-old boy whose body was thrown in a dumpster were sentenced to six years in prison after pleading no contest Thursday to charges in the baby's death.
Adam Manson, 34, and Kiana Williams, 32, each pleaded no contest to one felony count of child abuse resulting in death and admitted to a special allegation that they caused the death of their son, Jacsun Manson, the Los Angeles County district attorney announced.
Manson and Williams had initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The two had been doing drugs in a South L.A. motel on New Year's Eve when they found the baby dead, prosecutors said. They placed his body in a suitcase and tossed it in a trash bin near the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, prosecutors said.
In late April, weeks after searching through the El Sobrante Landfill in Corona, authorities called off the search. The child's body was never found.
Police said in a statement at the time that they made the decision to end the search for Jacsun with a "heavy heart," but noted they couldn't pinpoint a location in the landfill "to a point that would make continuing the search reasonable."
UK's medical drug supply still uncertain in no-deal Brexit
Britain's government watchdog says there is still a "significant amount" of work to do to ensure the country has an adequate supply of medical drugs in case of a no-deal Brexit.
In a report issued Friday, Britain's National Audit Office said additional shipping capacity chartered by the U.K. for sending goods across the English Channel might not be operational until the end of November - one month after the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union. Of the more than 12,300 medicines licensed in the U.K., about 7,000 arrive from or via the EU, mostly across the Channel.
According to the British government's "reasonable worst-case" scenario, the flow of goods could be cut by half on Day One of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover. It said time was "extremely limited" if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of October.
The report also said there was "incomplete information" about the levels of medicine stockpiling but that levels were increasingly daily. As of Sept. 20, suppliers reported that 72% of medicines had a six-week stockpile.
"In the event of a no-deal exit, the department (of health) would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hugely demanding task," the watchdog wrote.
Meg Hillier, who chairs a committee overseeing the audit office, called the findings "deeply concerning." She said she had seen "countless examples" of the British government missing deadlines, but that this one was particularly striking.
"If the government gets this wrong, it could have the gravest of consequences," she said.
Dr. Richard Torbett of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said that while companies have been working to prepare for Brexit, "some things are outside of their control."
He said more details were needed on how companies might access government-planned freight capacity if Britain sees a no-deal departure from the EU.
"Securing a (Brexit) deal remains the best way to protect patients," he said.
Cleveland police branded 'failing' in all areas by inspectors
Scandal-hit Cleveland police has become the first force to be branded "failing" in all areas by inspectors.
It has been rated inadequate overall and in three key areas by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), which scrutinised its ability to reduce crime and keep people safe, operate efficiently, as well as the way it treats the public and its workforce.
The findings mean the force is effectively plunged into special measures, where the chief constable and police and crime commissioner are called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure "critical improvements" are made.
The home secretary could then step in to tackle the problem if no progress is made.
A string of scandals has plagued the force, covering Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough in the north east of England.
It has seen six chief constables in almost as many years.
Former chief constable Sean Price was sacked for gross misconduct in 2012; seven officers were under investigation after journalists" phones were unlawfully monitored, and there have been long-standing claims of racism within the ranks.
Work practices were recently described by the chief inspector of constabulary as being about as "inefficient as you can possibly imagine," with officers having to share laptops and bodyworn cameras.
HM Inspector of Constabulary Phil Gormley said it was a "failing force" where there had been "significant" deterioration in the last two years.
Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said the report described the "worst findings ever into any police force in the country" which was "finally the official validation" that the force is "broken" and said the Home Office needed to intervene now.
He added: "It's no longer in dispute. It is a fact described in black and white in this report.
"The findings are some of the most distressing and shocking I have ever read."
Cleveland is one of 15 forces that has been recently inspected by HMICFRS inspectors, and the only one rated inadequate in all areas.
Gormley added: "The force doesn't appropriately prioritise crime prevention. There is a lack of strategic direction, and the force doesn't allocate enough resources to prevention work ... It is failing to respond appropriately to vulnerable people, including children. It is missing opportunities to safeguard them and exposing them to risk."
He said senior leaders were not consistently demonstrating "ethical behaviour," and the "inappropriate behaviour of senior leaders within Cleveland is so profound that it is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force."
He added: "It doesn't consistently treat its workforce with fairness and respect and it doesn't effectively communicate with or engage its workforce; its processes aren't perceived to be fair and it doesn't understand its workforce well enough to support them."
Despite the findings, the force did receive a small amount of praise for the way it tackles serious and organised crime but was told it must improve the way it investigates crimes.
The force's police and crime commissioner Barry Coppinger said: "I am deeply concerned at the worrying contents of this report.
"The force's recent performance is simply not good enough."
He said he had received assurances from the current chief constable Richard Lewis that "swift action" was taken as soon as he became aware of the failings.
Coppinger has been ordered by the Home Office to respond to the report within 56 days.
Lewis said the report would act "as a line in the sand" for the force, adding: "Improvements have already been made and I take full responsibility for driving through the changes that are so obviously needed. In the five months I've been here I have met some exceptional police officers and staff, at all levels, and have seen lives saved and vulnerable people protected by the efforts and determination of frontline officers."
If drastic improvements are not made quickly enough, the Government could step in, as it can when prisons are failing.
But so far politicians have never had to resort to this measure with police forces, inspectors said.
Kit Malthouse, minister for crime, policing and fire, said he welcomed the chief constable's "swift action to address these failings and will be monitoring the position closely," adding: "Transparency and accountability are vital for public trust in policing.
Immanuel Christian School: Sixth-grade boys accused of pinning down black girl and cutting off her dreadlocks in Virginia
A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of pinning her down and cutting off her dreadlocks. The incident took place at Immanuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, is a teacher.
Amari Allen, a 12-year-old student at the private K-12 Christian school, said the boys called her dreadlocks "ugly" and "nappy" before cutting them off on the playground during recess.
"They kept laughing and calling me names," Amari told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV, tearing up. "They called me 'ugly,' said, 'I shouldn't have been born.' They called me 'an attention-seeker.'"
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dreadlocks.
Amari didn't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed.
"They ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.
The alleged incident occurred on Monday, but the shy preteen said she didn't tell her family about it until Wednesday, after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different. She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth, she said.
"It's very painful," said Cynthia Allen, Amari's grandmother. "I want to see them dismissed from the school. I want to see something done."
Allen's family pays nearly $12,000 per year for Amari to attend the school, which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-LGBTQ institution.
"We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse," Immanuel Christian School said in a statement. "We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can. We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police."
While the school has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said the boys had previously tormented her. She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past.
Amari's family met with school officials Thursday, and the investigation is ongoing.
Iran releases British oil tanker Stena Impero
Iran released a British-flagged oil tanker on Friday, two months after it captured the vessel for allegedly entering its waters in violation of international law.
Iranian Ports and Maritime Administration confirmed that the vessel, Stena Impero, left Bandar Abbas port at 9 a.m., the state-run IRNA reported.
Erik Hanell, president and CEO of Stena Bulk, the operator of the ship, also confirmed the ship's release.
"Stena Bulk and Northern Marine Management confirm the Stena Impero and its crew have been released," he said via Twitter.
The ship was captured by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps on July 19 for having violated international maritime law when it allegedly veered into Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz.
The vessel's seizure, however, was widely seen as retaliatory for British forces capturing a tanker off Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions. The ship was released in mid-August despite the Trump administration making a last-ditch attempt to length its detention.
The Stena Impero was officially given permission to leave on Monday but was kept in port until a probe into the ship's conduct completed, the New York Times reported.
"The vessel has left the port of Bandar Abbas and is transiting to Dubai for the crew to disembark and receive medical checks and debriefing," Hanell said. "The families of crew members have been informed and the Company is currently making arrangements for the repatriation of its valued seafarers at the earliest possible opportunity."
The ship became victim to escalating tensions near the Persian Gulf where both the United States and Iran shot down the other's drone and at least two tankers were sabotaged by explosives, which the Trump administration has blamed Iran for.
The Trump administration most recently blamed Iran for drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, which Tehran denies having any involvement with.
PM Modi Tweets Tribute To Jacques Chirac, Calls Him True Global Statesman, Friend Of India
Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of former French president Jacques Chirac, saying India mourns the loss of a true global statesman and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who supported India after it conducted nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday at age 86. He served as the president of France from 1995 to 2007.
"My deepest condolences on passing away of Jacques Chirac. India mourns the loss of a true global statesman. A friend of India, he played a decisive role in establishing and building India-France Strategic Partnership," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
India and France have a strategic partnership, initiated in January 1998 during Jacques Chirac's first visit to India. He again visited the country as president in 2006.
Jacques Chirac was known to have been suffering from ill health for a long time.
Uganda: Government Launches Oral HIV Self-Test Kit
Ministry of Health has launched an oral HIV self-test kit aimed at empowering citizens, especially men to carry out HIV testing.
The initiative is aimed at reducing new HIV/Aids infections by 2020.
The oral HIV test kit dubbed, OraQuick HIV self-test, a product of Orasure technologies, targets young people aged 18 to 24 years, men and priority populations such as sex workers.
"Currently we are targeting young people 18 to 24 years. For the young people that's the age bracket we are looking at but of course any one above 18 and it's because we do not have evidence of children by the Constitution but as more evidence unfolds we are going to get there. For the men, we give the kit to the mother and they take it to the partner, key and priority populations such sex workers," Mr Geoffrey Tasi, the technical officer-in-charge of HIV testing services, said yesterday.
Easy use
Initially, the self-test kits available involve the use of blood to detect the HIV, however, with oral HIV self-test kit, oral fluids are involved.
The test works by detecting antibodies, the body's natural defenders against infection. If one is infected with HIV, these antibodies will be present in your blood and also in the salivia. The test will detect the antibodies in the mouth.
Data by the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC) shows that Uganda is registering 1,000 new HIV/Aids infections and 500 deaths from the viral disease per week, translating into 53,000 new infections and 23,000 deaths annually.
Dr Diana Atwine, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, said this is timely and will enhance the fight against HIV/Aids.
She, however, urged the men to take HIV testing as an important issue.
She added that there is still effort to reach the 14 per cent of the people, who are living with HIV but do not know their HIV status.
"Currently, 86 per cent people living with HIV know their status; that means it leave us with 14 per cent of those living with HIV and do not know their status. So how do we now utilise that additional innovation. Really for me this is it ... how do we now move from this kit and create demand, especially for that 14 per cent that are sick and they need care and they are not getting care," Dr Atwine said.
However, health officials warn one should not eat or drink within 15 minutes before starting the test.
Mr Tasi said studies conducted showed no suicide cases and the ministry is confident that the potential of harm can be avoided because the test is voluntary.
Dr Atwine said apart from graphics and videos provided to educate the users, there should be toll free numbers always available to offer counselling in both government and private facilities, including all pharmacies.
Research. According to the research, OraQuick HIV self-test detected more than 99 per cent of people, who were infected with HIV and people, who were not infected with HIV.
Athletes feeling the heat at Qatar world championships
Some competitors at the world athletics championships that began on Friday have already encountered their most challenging opponent: the sweltering Qatari heat.
With its suffocating humidity and daytime temperatures hovering around 38 degrees Celsius, Doha weather has been widely discussed among athletes and athletics officials and seen as a cause for concern in some events.
Those competing on the road in the marathon and walking races will begin their events in the middle of the night to minimize the heat's harmful effects.
Although the heat is less of a threat to the athletes competing inside the Khalifa International Stadium, where temperatures are kept at around 21 degrees with the help of a cooling system, they have still had to adjust their training because they practise at an outdoor facility.
"We are from a hot climate as well, but nothing to compare with this," Bahamian coach Ronald Cartwright told Reuters.
"Here you walk outside and it's like somebody put a heater on you. I guess that is why they are doing it at night."
Athletics officials have pledged additional medical and safety measures for marathon runners and race walkers.
The IAAF, the global governing body of athletics, said the women's marathon, scheduled to start at midnight on Friday, would go ahead as planned as temperatures would be at or below 30 degrees.
It said its medical delegate had assured athletes that weather conditions would be monitored all day and reported to the teams "to ensure the event is run at an acceptable level of health risk."
Track athletes competing inside the stadium said it was unlikely that the heat would significantly affect their performances, but conceded that practices have been especially draining.
"At practice I'm glowing because I'm sweating because it's so humid," said Rai Benjamin, who competes in the 400m hurdles.
"It's like I got out of the shower. But I don't think it will be that bad because of the cooling system."
Shot putter Ryan Crouser, the 2016 Olympic champion, said he has had to heat up his shots to around 38 degrees Celsius to prevent them from becoming wet during practices in the sizzling heat and high humidity.
"The shot is far below the dew point, the instant you take it out, it's just soaking wet and it's dripping water," the American said. "It's worse than if it was pouring down rain... We've been fighting this a little bit."
European pole vault champion Armand Duplantis, who trains in the heat of the southern U.S. state of Louisiana, said the humidity can prove helpful in practice because the addition of moisture to the chalk on his hands "makes for a really nice grip."
But other pole vaulters who spray a sticky grip enhancer on their hands might have more difficulty holding onto their poles in the humidity, he said.
"For people who use sticky spray, I can see it being a problem because it can get a little slimy and gooey," Duplantis said.
Fears of security breach at major prison as locksmith is arrested
A prison locksmith has been arrested amid fears keys to a jail's cells have been copied resulting in taxpayers footing a £500,000 bill to replace all its locks.
HMP Wandsworth called in police amid fears that duplicates had been sold to some of its 1,400 inmates.
The suspected security breach will result in 3,000 locks replaced, potentially to cell, internal and outer doors.
Police arrested a 40-year-old man at the jail on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office on September 13. The man, from South West London, was working for the Government Facility Services Ltd, which maintains 52 jails across the south of the country.
The police investigation has raised concerns that imprints of some of the keys may have been taken in clay before actual copies were produced.
However, prison bosses stressed that they had not found any evidence that inmates had obtained any keys.
Wandsworth Prison is a Category B jail in South West London which can house up to 1,628 prisoners, making it one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. The jail, built in 1851, holds convicted male criminals and those on remand awaiting trial.
A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "HMP Wandsworth has increased security at the gate and is operating extra identity checks as a result of a security incident. It would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is ongoing."
House chairmen warn Trump to stop attacking whistleblower
"The President's comments today constitute reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress' impeachment inquiry. We condemn the President's attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers," they said. "Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security."
The statement said Trump "is fully aware that our Committees are seeking testimony from this whistleblower and others referenced in the whistleblower's complaint released today as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, and our nation's laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate, or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress."
"No officials with knowledge relevant to the committees' investigation, including knowledge of the subject of the whistleblower complaint, may be subject to any intimidation, reprisal, or threat of reprisal, and all witnesses must be made available for congressional testimony," they added.
The statement on Thursday comes amidst an explosive week in Washington rooted in a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump abused his official powers "to solicit interference" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election, and the White House took steps to cover it up. A transcript of July phone conversation released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.
Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday declared Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President.
Michelle Obama Calls Meghan Markle 'An Inspiration' In Adoring Instagram
Michelle Obama gave high praise to Meghan Markle in a sweet Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it."
The duchess and Prince Harry, now on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a youth reception earlier this week and met Obama Foundation leaders.
"Thank you to my friend, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a thoughtful leader who is breaking the mold and making our world better for it," the former first lady wrote in her glowing post.
"Whether meeting with our @ObamaFoundation Leaders or helping girls around the world seek the education they deserve, she is an inspiration to so many," Obama added, alongside a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with foundation leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, which the former "Suits" actress guest-edited. In their candid chat, the former first lady reflected on motherhood and how it's changed her.
"Being a mother has been a masterclass in letting go," Obama said in the interview.
"Motherhood has taught me that, most of the time, my job is to give them the space to explore and develop into the people they want to be. Not who I want them to be or who I wish I was at that age, but who they are, deep inside."
Obama, who knows first-hand the pressure of being under a global spotlight, doled out some advice to the duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeping.
"The pressure you feel ― from yourself and from others ― can sometimes feel like a lot," she said. "So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don't be in a hurry to do anything."
She continued:
I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work. I think it's okay - it's good, even - to do that.
Moment hero police officer rushes onto busy motorway to save dog hit by car
This is the heroic moment a police officer ran out onto a busy motorway to rescue an injured dog.
Footage from Joseph Puglia's dashcam shows him jumping out of his police car within seconds of seeing the dog get hit by another vehicle.
The officer, who works in Pinellas Park, Florida, wrapped the wounded pup in an emergency blanket, placed him in his SUV rushed to the nearest animal hospital.
"My heart really sank until I started seeing him breathing," Mr Puglia told ABC news.
Thankfully, the dog survived with just minor cuts and bruises.
"We nicknamed him "Lucky" and I think the name applies," the officer said. "He's definitely one lucky dog."
The dog was brought to a local animal shelter and his rescuer has since been hailed as a hero.
But Mr Puglia insists he was just doing his job.
The officer added that if animal services cannot find the owner, some of his family members would be more than willing to give Lucky a home.
After WeWork debacle, IPO market slams brakes on unprofitable companies
BOSTON (Reuters) - Companies making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough welcome, especially if they are losing money, casting a shadow over the calendar for initial public offerings for the rest of the year.
The surprise postponement of the WeWork IPO has underscored how confidence is eroding in the market both for companies looking to raise capital and investors.
A more discerning market for initial public offerings continued to punish Peloton Interactive Inc PTON.O on Friday, a day after it began trading, as shares of the fitness startup fell 4% to $24.74. The company is now trading 15% below its Wednesday IPO price.
In the past, public market investors have typically expected companies to become profitable within 18 months or so of an IPO. This timeline has been relaxed with money managers eager to add businesses with fast-growing revenue to their portfolios.
Recent deals, however, suggest an uncertain economic outlook is pushing investors to be more selective about the loss-making companies they are willing to back.
Peloton reported rapid top-line growth of 110% during the fiscal year that ended June 30. But the company also showed negative operating leverage, with operating expenses surging 147% over the prior year.
Loss-making teeth-alignment company SmileDirectClub SDC.O earlier this month became the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first trading day, according to research firm Renaissance Capital.
The average IPO return in 2019 is now about 9%, down from more than 30% at the end of June and more than 18% about two weeks ago.
In the United States, much of the attention in the third quarter has focused on a deal that failed to come to fruition - the planned IPO of WeWork parent We Company.
Having aimed to launch its IPO earlier in September, the company postponed plans to list until later in 2019, before replacing its chief executive officer and saying it was reviewing its timetable to go public.
Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), an entertainment and talent agency company backed by Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel with a track record of losses, made a last-minute decision to abandon its IPO due to the tough market conditions. Taking a lesson from the struggles earlier in 2019 of ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O), which have no stated timetable for becoming profitable, investors have started to push back on companies with a history of steep losses. "It will be a dialogue among bankers and boards and senior management teams where they say, "these were isolated and not comparable," or say "we have a sentiment shift and we need to be more conservative and use a different strategy,"" said David Ethridge, U.S. IPO services leader at audit firm PwC. The market was more receptive to lesser-known names such as cyber security company Ping Identity PING.N and cloud monitoring company Datadog Inc DDOG.O. Both companies have reported more modest losses and rely on selling to companies rather than to consumers.
Jonathan Van Ness Just Hung Out With Nancy Pelosi And They've Got A Plan
"Queer Eye" star Jonathan Van Ness strutted his stuff on Capitol Hill on Thursday, joining forces with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to discuss the Equality Act.
The Equality Act would extend nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ individuals in credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury service and public accommodations.
The bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of already protected classes.
Van Ness, who recently publicly came out as HIV positive, first shared a video of himself cat-walking in the Capitol, explaining in his caption that he'd met with the House speaker to talk Equality Act, living with HIV and access to PrEP (an HIV preventative medication):
He then shared a longer post picturing the two of them arm in arm, urging his followers to stand up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and apply pressure to GOP senators to bring the Equality Act up for a Senate vote:
Pelosi introduced the Equality Act on March 13. The House passed the legislation in May. It has not yet been brought to the Senate floor.
In August, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to essentially legalize anti-gay discrimination in the workplace, arguing in an amicus brief that the federal laws on employer discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were not intended to protect individuals from being fired based on their sexual orientation.
Pelosi met earlier this year with Van Ness and three of his "Queer Eye" co-stars as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), to talk policy and promote the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared her own image of herself and Van Ness warmly holding hands on a balcony, thanking him for bringing his voice to the fight:
David Attenborough working on new documentary about animals and colour
David Attenborough is 93-years-old but the iconic nature guru is not slowing down just yet.
No, after the success of his groundbreaking Netflix documentary Our Planet, the much loved star is set to return with another series: Life In Colour.
This time, the father-of-two will look at how animals use colour in their lives through high-tech cameras that were built especially for the programme.
The BBC have revealed that the star aims to show "a world of colour normally invisible to human eyes" - and it sounds truly fascinating.
However, despite fans being eager for the upcoming release, it seems we all need to sit tight as it won't be dropping on our screens until 2021.
But we're sure it'll be worth the wait.
Earlier this month, David was presented with the TV Choice Lifetime Achievement Award, at the prestigious ceremony in London.
The national treasure has entertained millions over his career, which has so far spanned 60 years.
When collecting his gong, the reporter enthused: "Indeed. What I do isn't always entertaining, and sometimes people hear things they don't like!
"But this is an honour and a great pleasure."
TV Choice said of the winner: "Still working, learning and making programmes Sir David Attenborough isn't just a British hero, he's a global icon."
This week, David was celebrated once again as a polar research ship was named after him.
The star joined both Prince William and Kate for the naming ceremony in Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
He said: "It's no news to any of you that the world is facing great, great problems and the most aware of that are the young people of today, who will inherit this world.
"Great problems require great research and facts in order to solve them.
"That's what this astonishing ship will be here to do, to find out the facts and find the science with which to deal with problems that are facing the world today and will increasingly do so tomorrow."
Life In Colour is expected to air on BBC Two in 2021, while it's said Netflix will retain global rights.
Don't use my wife's name to score points, says husband of murdered MP Jo Cox
The husband of Jo Cox said his wife's name must not be used to score political points after Jeremy Corbyn last night posted footage of the murdered MP to criticise Boris Johnson.
The Labour leader's film featured clips of Mrs Cox and a vigil held after her death, with the caption: "Boris Johnson does not care about violence on our streets."
Critics said Mr Corbyn was using her murder to score "cheap political points" while her husband Brendan Cox said the Labour leader was "wrong" to infer hateful language was a "simple party political issue."
Mr Cox said: "Jeremy is right that the best way to honour Jo is to defeat hatred and division. He's also right the PM has a particular responsibility.
"But he's wrong to infer this is a simple party political issue. Jo was passionately Labour but some things must transcend party politics."
He also shared a post which said Jo Cox's name was "more than a political scoring point" with the caption "This. Thank you." Mr Corbyn was facing a backlash for his video which opens with him talking about Mrs Cox's murder three years ago by a far-Right activist in her West Yorkshire constituency.
Speaking over a montage of clips of Mrs Cox, Mr Johnson and female MPs, Mr Corbyn said: "This Prime Minister knows these words can promote violence and have real consequences. He wants division. Clearly, he doesn't care about the violence on our streets."
He goes on to criticise Mr Johnson and call for a Labour government.
Mr Corbyn added: "Many are deeply concerned about the language used by Boris Johnson, language which is being repeated by the far-Right. When this was raised with him by women MPs, who themselves face death threats, he arrogantly dismissed them. It was nothing short of disgraceful." Former Labour MP John Woodcock shared the video and said: "You can really shut up. Disgusting."
Meanwhile Tory MP and business minister Nadhim Zahawi said: "You are so wrong to use Jo Cox in this way, when her family have specifically asked for her not to be used in this way. To be kept out of politics.
"If you have an ounce of decency Jeremy Corbyn you would take this video down." It follows a row over language in Parliament this week in which Mr Johnson said that the "best way" to honour Mrs Cox was to "get Brexit done." Her sister Kim Leadbeater called for a dialling down of extreme language saying it was "not helpful to Jo's kids."
She told ITV: "For me to come out and say outrageous things about Boris Johnson - I just don't think that's a useful way of moving forward. I can say what I think is right and what I think is wrong but I'm going to try and do that in a measured manner."
The daughter of Labour MP Yvette Cooper spoke out yesterday to say she constantly fears for her mother's life because of the way people speak about politicians.
House rebukes Trump on border wall, but he plans veto
The Democratic-controlled House is making a second attempt to overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to raid military base projects such as schools and target ranges to pay for his long-promised border fence.
The 236-174 vote sent the legislation to Trump, who is sure to veto it just as he killed a similar measure in March.
The Senate passed the measure last week with about a dozen veteran Republican lawmakers rebuking Trump.
Friday's vote was different because it followed the recent release by the administration of a list of 127 military construction projects totaling $3.6 billion that will be canceled to pay for the border wall, including numerous projects in GOP districts and states.
Brazil says oil in spill along northeast beaches not Brazilian
Brazil's environmental agency Ibama said on Thursday that an analysis of a vast oil spill along the country's northeastern beaches showed the spilled crude did not originate in the country.
Ibama said in a statement that it had been investigating the spill in several beaches in some northeastern states since Sept. 2. Local media showed pictures of sea turtles coated in black tar by the slick.
The spill spans over 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) of Brazil's northeast coast, affecting wildlife and polluting some of the postcard beaches in one of the nation's top touristic destinations, such as Praia do Futuro, in the state of Ceara, and Maragogi, in Alagoas state.
Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA said in a statement that it had concluded after a molecular analysis of the oil that the crude spilled was not produced nor sold by the company.
Crude oil is tested before export to make sure it complies with the standards of the refinery it is being shipped to. Crude oil from different fields can be identified according to a series of chemical signatures, including levels of sulfur and nitrogen, acidity and viscosity.
The head of Brazil's oil agency ANP Decio Oddone said the agency believes the oil could have been spilled by a tanker transporting the crude far from the Brazilian coast, but added this possibility has not yet been confirmed yet. An ANP statement said there were no reports of spills by any operator of oil drilling rigs in the country.
Some marine turtles were contaminated by the oil. They were rescued alive in the state of Rio Grande do Norte and sent to rehabilitation centers. Other animals were found dead, Ibama said, without disclosing species or numbers.
Petrobras, as the state oil company is known, said in a statement that even though it was not involved in the spill it was contributing to the clean-up efforts, with some 100 Petrobras employees helping clean the beaches.
Skoda to provide drivers with voice activated digital assistant
Skoda is to introduce a digital assistant that can be activated with a verbal command. In an announcement Wednesday, the Czech car maker said the digital assistant could be activated by the phrase "Okay, Laura."
The system, which supports six languages, is able to undertake a range of tasks including starting navigation to a destination and searching for music. It will initially be available in models of the Kamiq city SUV and the compact Scala. Part of the Volkswagen Group since 1991, the Skoda brand delivered 1.25 million vehicles globally in 2018, according to its annual report.
The company's introduction of a virtual, voice activated assistant mirrors efforts by other manufacturers in the sector. Some BMW cars, for instance, are now equipped with an "intelligent personal assistant" which can be activated by using a button, a personal activation word or the phrase "Hello, BMW." Verbal commands can be used to, among other things, activate seat heating, get information on tire pressure, and adjust the in-car temperature.
"Voice is the ideal interaction tool in the vehicle," Jack Palmer, a senior connected car specialist at SBD Automotive, said in a statement sent to CNBC via email on Thursday.
"If the lion's share of commands from the driver can be inputted through virtual assistants, rather than fiddling around with touchscreens and buttons, the current epidemic of driver distraction will be greatly mitigated," Palmer added. "Automakers have realized this and the race is on for them to integrate their own solutions or partner with consumer electronics companies such as Google and Amazon."
The moves by firms such as Skoda and BMW point to a potential shift in the way people interact with their cars. Hannah Keshishian, an automotive analyst at market intelligence firm Mintel, told CNBC via email that one of its recent reports had highlighted how nearly 40% of U.S. consumers who owned a vehicle "would like to use a digital personal assistant in their vehicle." This, she added, "opens the door to greater possibilities for digital assistant vehicle connectivity."
Ghana: World Rabies Day Observed
The 13th World Rabies Day was marked in Accra on Wednesday with a call on pet owners to vaccinate their dogs in order to safeguard the lives of the citizenry.
The programme which was held under the theme "Rabies: Vaccinate to eliminate" was organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture Veterinary Service.
It was aimed at highlighting the essential role of mass canine vaccination in rabies elimination in the country.
Addressing the conference, the Assistant Director General and FAO Representative to Ghana, Mr Abebe Haile-Gabriel indicated that the issue of rabies could be minimised if efforts were geared towards vaccination and keeping stray animals away from humans especially children.
According to him, the 'Zero by 30' Global Strategic Plan "of the 500,000 people who died from rabies each year, 40 per cent are children living in Asia and Africa," and called for holistic approach to deal with the situation to save kids from rabies.
Mr Haile-Gabriel stated that most stray animals carried rabies and re-echoed the need for the country to supplement the United against Rabies 2030 strategy that requires the pet owners to vaccinate animals that carried zoonotic diseases.
He underscored the need for the country to embark on five-year campaign and vaccination programme to create awareness to eliminate potential exposure of human to rabies.
A comprehensive roadmap for progressive elimination of rabies, he noted had been rolled out through the Ghana Rabies and Prevention Action Plan (2018-2030) to end epidemics of neglected tropical diseases by 2030.
Mr Haile-Gabriel pledged the readiness of the FAO to collaborate with other stakeholders in preventing and controlling rabies in the country.
Dr Owen Kaluwa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Representative to Ghana observed that rabies was an endemic which had to be controlled to save lives.
He explained that through the "Zero human rabies deaths by 2030" strategy, countries were supported to develop and implement their national rabies elimination plans that embrace the One Health Concept and cross sectoral collaboration.
Dr Kaluwa noted that 99 per cent of zoonotic disease like rabies was transmitted from dogs to humans, adding that One Health approach to controlling and ultimately eliminating human rabies was expedient.
Director of Veterinary Service, Dr Asiedu Baah lamented that rabies had become global burden.
"Though rabies has no cure, the infection is vaccine preventable, hence its elimination is feasible therefore any animal owner must ensure their animals are vaccinated," he stated.
Dr Baah said although rabies was fully preventable using appropriate sustainable control strategies, lack of funds and concerted efforts had continued to result in escalation of human death and the spread of the endemic.
"It is imperative that the animal sector is adequately resourced to prevent transmission of rabies in dogs as a protective measure against the disease," he added.
The 12-year-old who "silenced the world"
Greta Thunberg has established herself as the planet's spokeswoman on climate change at the tender age of 16. But long before social media, another teenager was scolding UN leaders on the world stage 27 years ago.
In the year since she organized school walkouts in her native Sweden to protest climate change, Greta Thunberg's environmental crusade has been unavoidable, culminating on Monday in an angry and passionate speech before the UN's Climate Action Summit, in which she lambasted politicians for stealing her "dreams" and her "childhood" with "empty words" while humanity stares down "a mass extinction."
Thunberg's grim pronouncements have earned her savage criticism, and glowing praise. New York Magazine called her "the Joan of Arc of climate change," while The Guardian ranked her speech alongside President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address for its historical significance.
Then again, they said the same about Severn Cullis-Suzuki in 1992. Long before Thunberg deadpanned to parliamentarians that "we probably don't even have a future any more," and netizens tore each other to shreds attacking and defending her, 12-year-old Cullis-Suzuki became known as the "The girl who silenced the world for five minutes" when she delivered a similar sermon before the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The tone of Cullis-Suzuki's speech is strikingly similar to Thunberg's. "We've come...to tell you adults that you must change your ways," she opened, just like Thunberg told the assembled adults "we will not let you get away with this."
Just as Thunberg told the UN summit "we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money and fairytales of eternal economic growth," Cullis-Suzuki told leaders that "losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market."
And underpinning both girls" messages was a nihilistic fatalism. "I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the hole in our ozone. I am afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemicals are in it," Cullis-Suzuki said in 1992. Striking schoolchildren in 2019 carry banners reading "You'll die of old age, I'll die of climate change."
The environmental problems addressed by Cullis-Suzuki reflect the world of the early 1990s, when deforestation, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the extinction of species were the ecological concerns de jour. Yet humanity has been fairly successful at resolving those problems in the intervening years. Thanks to a landmark chemicals ban, ozone depletion has slowed dramatically, and forest cover worldwide has increased by an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined.
Cullis-Suzuki herself went on to found an environmental think tank and work for UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's Special Advisory Panel in the early 2000s.
So what does the future have in store for Thunberg? Well that depends how you look at Cullis-Suzuki's example. On one hand, none of her worst fears came to pass. On the other, world governments still have ecological problems to contend with, and are still being lectured by children about them.
Assuming the world as we know it still exists 27 years from now - as Thunberg says it won't unless we slash carbon emissions to absolute zero in the next decade or so - then the teenage activist will likely look back on a long UN and NGO career that kicked off with one famous speech.
By then, another concerned child will likely be delivering a passionate warning about acid rain in the Martian colonies.
SNP could support Jeremy Corbyn as temporary PM to stop no-deal Brexit
The SNP has signalled it could support installing Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street on a temporary basis to thwart a no-deal Brexit.
As tensions between MPs and Downing Street deepened, Nicola Sturgeon suggested it could row in behind the Labour leader as a caretaker prime minister until a general election.
Mr Corbyn called on rebel Tories and opposition MPs to back him to lead a temporary administration in August - but the move was met with resistance, particularly from the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson.
Under the proposals, opposition parties would seek to oust Boris Johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU on 31 October.
The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but senior figures in the SNP are concerned that Mr Johnson could defy a law forcing him to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 October.
Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, suggested that Mr Corbyn could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving Mr Johnson in charge would be a "terrible idea."
Responding to a tweet suggesting installing the Labour leader or another temporary prime minister, she said: "Agree with this.
"Vote of no confidence, opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension, and then immediate general election.
"Nothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me."
Veteran MPs Harriet Harman and Ken Clarke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior SNP source insisted it had to be the Labour leader.
"It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence, so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election," the source told ITV's Robert Peston.
"Trying to find a compromise candidate, a national unity candidate, is too complicated, especially in the time we have. Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn."
An SNP spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing "this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible."
The spokesperson said: "It is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards.
"We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson."
Even with SNP support, it would come down to a knife-edge vote for Mr Corbyn. There are 288 Tory MPs, as well as 10 Democratic Unionists, so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent MPs to come on board.
Labour argued that the plan was the "simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal."
However the Liberal Democrats believe a temporary government led by Mr Corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the House, as he would need the backing of ex-Tory MPs and defectors from his own party.
Kirstene Hair, Tory MP for Angus, said: "This report confirms what many have long suspected - SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in No10.
"There is no doubt that Corbyn's weak stance on indyref2 is a deciding factor for the nationalists.
"He has already left the door open for a re-run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister.
"Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted "No" in what was meant to be a once in a generation event."
Over 50 Surrey University students banned from sports teams amid accusations of sexual harassment
"People are just doing everything you would expect from a lads holiday. It is accepted that this is an alcohol heavy, raucous trip."
However, students said that this year behaviour of some students went too far, particularly during a game which involved members of the football club being dared by their teammates to make advances on women, while their friends attempt to "intercept" them.
Alan Sutherland, chief executive of Surrey's student unions said: "We became aware of the misconduct, and as investigations proceeded any individual students who were accused of committing a "major" offence as per the student disciplinary regulations were referred to a university investigation."
Three students were formally disciplined by the university, which launched its own investigation into the football team's conduct.
One student was expelled for three counts of sexual misconduct or harassment, and one count of aggressive behaviour.
Meanwhile two other students, who were also accused of harassment, were issued with final warnings and made to issue apologies.
One was banned from University premises at certain times and the other was banned from attending organised social events. All three students were banned from attending their graduation ceremonies.
The Surrey University men's football club said that they "sincerely apologise" for its members actions during the Croatia tour.
Matt de Grood shouldn't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma
In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.
Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings. The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea. There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.
First, let's examine the more pessimistic side. De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break. It was a violent and unpredictable attack. He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication. His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe." Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense. But is this reason enough to remain afraid? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?
As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear. Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized. This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.
That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur. In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence. In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.
I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently. A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well. Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation. It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals. He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?
Hungarian PM Orban defends his candidate for EU executive, "has solutions in pocket"
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said he has several solutions "in his pocket" after Hungary's candidate for the European Commission was rejected.
The EU transport commissioner-designate, Romanian socialist politician Rovana Plumb, and the proposed commissioner for EU enlargement, former Hungarian justice minister Laszlo Trocsanyi, were told their confirmation hearings could not go ahead because of inconsistencies in their financial statements, Reuters reported.
"I am convinced that [Trocsanyi] is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the European Commission," Orban said. "His sin was that he helped the government and me... to protect Hungary from migration."
The move is seen as an embarrassment for Orban, who proposed Trocsanyi, and who has been in constant conflict with Brussels over his migration policy and other issues.
Babies on a plane: Japan Airlines unveils tool to tackle horror of screaming infants
Being stuck on a long-haul flight within earshot of a crying baby could be a thing of the past for passengers on Japan Airlines (JAL), after the carrier unveiled an online booking tool that indicates where toddlers will be seated.
When passengers with children aged between eight days and two years old reserve their seat, a child icon automatically appears on the seat plan, alerting other passengers who have yet to select their seats.
JAL was quick to point out that the new feature did not guarantee that passengers would be out of earshot of a screaming infant.
The icon would not appear if passengers booked their flight through a third party or were part of a tour group, or if there was a last-minute change of aircraft, the airline's website said.
JAL and other airlines have yet to come up with way of anticipating seat reservations by serial snorers and passengers who fully recline their seats during in-flight meals.
But the move attracted praise from some social media users.
"Thank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip," Rahat Ahmed, a businessman, tweeted. "This really ought to be mandatory across the board."
Others, though, castigated travellers for intolerance towards fellow passengers.
"They are babies, as we all once were. We need to learn tolerance or will soon start needing a map of seat locations for mouth breathers, droolers, farters, drunks, and perhaps a lot more things in life," one user said.
Pompeo accuses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attack
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad's government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19.
"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompeo told a news conference.
U.S. officials in May said they'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time.
In April 2018, the U.S., Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
"This is different in some sense because it was chlorine... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons," Pompeo said.
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use.
Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners, including American journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years.
"He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all."
Tesla jumps on report Musk aims to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter
Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Motors.
Shares of Tesla jumped more than 5% after Electrek, an electric vehicle news website, reported that CEO Elon Musk said the company "has a shot" at delivering 100,000 cars this quarter, which would be a new record.
Electrek attributed the update to a leaked email from Musk sent to his employees at Tesla. Musk wrote in the email: "We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarter, which is an incredibly exciting milestone for our company!"
The CEO also reportedly added, "The challenge is making sure that we have the right car variants in the right locations and rallying as much as our company resources as possible to help with the end of the quarter deliveries."
The automaker is expected to report its quarterly vehicle deliveries in the next few days.
Last quarter, Tesla delivered approximately 95,000 electric vehicles.
Greece: 5 deny poor women's babies sold in illegal adoptions
Five Greek and Georgian citizens have appeared in court on charges of belonging to a criminal organization that allegedly sold babies for adoption.
All five denied the charges before a Thessaloniki magistrate on Friday. The two Georgian nationals are accused of being the ringleaders.
The gang allegedly recruited pregnant Bulgarian women who were destitute and willing to give up newborns they might deliver. Authorities say the group sold babies to childless Greek couples.
A total 12 people were arrested this week in connection with the alleged illegal adoptions and the alleged sale of human eggs. Another 54 have been charged with complicity.
Police say it was one of the biggest and best-organized gangs of its kind in Europe. The continent's Europol police agency assisted the investigation.
Mike Pompeo says Syrian government used chlorine in May chemical weapon attack
Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, said on Thursday that the United States had concluded the Syrian government had used chlorine as a chemical weapon in an attack in May during a battle with insurgents in Idlib.
"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities, some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Mr Pompeo told a news conference in New York, where he has been attending the United Nations General Assembly.
"Today I am announcing that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chlorine as a chemical weapon on May 19," Mr Pompeo added.
The United States said in May it had received numerous reports that appeared consistent with chemical exposure after an attack by the forces of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, in northwestern Syria, but it had made no definitive conclusion as to whether they used chemical weapons.
The Trump administration has twice bombed Syria over Assad's suspected use of chemical weapons, in April 2017 and April 2018.
Father Remains Hopeful That Suspect Who Fatally Shot Son One Year Ago Will Be Caught
It's been one year since a 20-year-old from Long Beach was fatally shot, but the victim's family isn't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught.
"I wish I could trade places with you son, I wish I could trade places with you," Guy Alford, the victim's father, said.
Alford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son, Guy Alford III, was gunned down at a Jack In The Box near 52nd and Atlantic. He said he wanted to call attention to his son's unsolved murder.
"Somebody knows something, they need to say something," he said.
Security video, which has never been released, showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him. Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car. One of them walked up to the driver's side, and shot Alford. The four people in Alford's car jumped out and ran. The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away.
"Wherever this coward is, he will get caught," Alford said.
This grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son, and he said he still didn't know who was in the car with him when he was shot.
"They upped and ran out of my son's car like that, where did you run to," Alford said. "Did you go back and try to help him or what? Nobody said nothing."
Alford said his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, then a stand-out safety on the Long Beach City College football team. Alford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse.
"He was working three jobs," Michael Harvey, a friend, said. "As somebody who's 21, he was a year younger than me, anybody with that type of hustle and work ethic, you tend to look up to."
As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues, Alford said he wasn't giving up either.
"I can assure you, this one is going to get solved," he said.
Alford is personally offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police.
Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here
Humiliation in the courts at home is a taste of what awaits Johnson in Brussels if he tries to weasel out of his commitments to request an extension. That will comfort European officials, who would most probably agree to it. Mainly because taking more time to find a solution reduces the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would be economically harmful to both sides.
Yet European diplomats can also see that the political bedlam in the UK lends itself to delay without decisions. Lawmakers in Parliament were able to set aside their differences to tie Johnson's hands and seek an extension, but that's about all they can agree on. This is the same Parliament that rejected the former prime minister Theresa May's hard-fought Brexit deal with the EU three times. Unless there's an election - another decision on which MPs have a final say - that won't change.
But even an election is a grim prospect for European capitals hoping for a friendly resolution to the Brexit mess. The opposition Labour Party's Brexit policy is a painful contortion act that's almost impossible to understand; the centrist Liberal Democrats' idea to cancel Brexit altogether is seen as extreme. The longer this drags on, the more it eats away at the smooth functioning of the EU.
There might be more optimism in Brussels if the outline of a workable deal was already sitting on a desk somewhere in the European Commission's Berlaymont headquarters. But there isn't.
Johnson's regular bashing of his predecessor's "backstop" proposal to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland and protect the EU single market hasn't led to any convincing alternatives. Officials say the proposals sent in by the UK on alternative arrangements aren't concrete enough to be considered operational in time for an October 31 exit.
And Johnson's weakness will give the 27 leaders facing him even less incentive to erase crucial red lines, despite the claim by Michael Gove, the UK minister in charge of a no-deal Brexit, that they're "shifting" on the backstop.
In an ideal world, a series of blows landing on Johnson - who is also under fire over his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit - would bring the match closer to an end. Europe should still try to extract maximum concessions from the UK, given it has no choice but to negotiate with the current government while trying to preserve unity among the rest of its 27 member states - which is going to get harder the longer this drags on. If there's a window to try yet again to put a deal before the UK parliament, the EU should grab it.
But this is more like a soccer match with 27 players on one side lining up to defend while the player in the opposite team tries to pick up the ball and go home.
The EU is good at setting rules and red lines and sticking to them; it's less good at unilaterally imposing its will. The UK is hemmed in by its own internal contradictions, at least until an election or a second referendum breaks the impasse.
Brexit can get plenty more toxic from here.
Black hole swallowing and ripping apart star captured for first time
A gigantic black hole has been captured pulling in and ripping apart a star for the first time.
The star, which was about the same size as our sun, was seen from 375 million light years away warping and spiralling into the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, researchers said in the Astrophysical Journal.
It was then sucked into oblivion in a rare cosmic occurrence astronomers call a tidal disruption event.
NASA's planet-searching telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite - TESS - captured the detailed timeline from beginning to end for the first time.
Astronomers used a worldwide network of telescopes to detect the phenomenon before looking at TESS, whose permanent viewing zones designed to find distant planets, caught the beginning of the violent event.
Thomas Holoien, an astronomer for the Carnegie Institution for Science who led the research, said: "This was really a combination of both being good and being lucky, and sometimes that's what you need to push the science forward."
Stars get sucked in when they venture too close to a supermassive black hole, which lives at the centre of most galaxies, including the Earth's Milky Way.
The black hole's impressive gravitational forces tear the star apart, with some of its material thrown into space and the rest into the black hole, forming a disc of hot, bright gas as it is swallowed.
Mr Holoien added: "Specifically, we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brightening, and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique."
UK business committee to probe Thomas Cook collapse
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said today that 72 flights are scheduled to operate to bring back a further 16,000 people to the country following the collapse of travel group Thomas Cook.
The aviation regulator said it has brought back over 40% of the total number of passengers in the largest peacetime repatriation 'Operation Matterhorn' launched on Monday.
Meanwhile, the British parliament's business committee has launched an inquiry into the collapse of Thomas Cook and will seek to question the management over issues such as executive pay and accounting practices.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest tour operator, collapsed in the early hours of Monday, hitting hotel owners, tourist sites and resorts around the world.
"The main players in the sad demise of Britain's oldest travel firm should face public scrutiny and be held to account for their actions before the company collapsed," said Rachel Reeves, Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee.
Evidence hearings will begin in mid-to-late October.
"Directors will welcome the opportunity to set the record straight and demonstrate that their conduct was always in the best interests of Thomas Cook's customers, employees and stakeholders," a person familiar with the company told Reuters.
Why The Times Published Details of the Whistle-Blower's Identity
On Thursday, The Times published exclusive details about the identity of the whistle-blower whose claims led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week. (The article reported that the whistle-blower is a C.I.A. officer who was previously detailed to work at the White House and had expertise on Ukraine.)
Many readers, including some who work in national security and intelligence, have criticized The Times's decision to publish the details, saying it potentially put the person's life in danger and may have a chilling effect on would-be whistle-blowers.
We took their concerns to Dean Baquet, The Times's executive editor, who responded to them in a discussion with the Reader Center:
The president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding. The president himself has called the whistle-blower's account a "political hack job."
We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower - including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House - because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.
China Says It Didn't Fight Any War Nor Invaded Foreign Land
China on Friday said it has not provoked a "single war or conflict" or "invaded a single square" of foreign land, skirting any reference to the 1962 war with India.
"China has always been dedicated to resolving territorial and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation," stated an official white paper released, four days ahead of the country set to celebrate its 70th anniversary of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on October 1.
"China safeguards world peace through real actions. Over the past 70 years, China has not provoked a single war or conflict, nor invaded a single square of foreign land," the paper titled "China and the World in the New Era" said.
The white paper, while highlighting the CPS's "peaceful rise" made no reference of the bloody 1962 war with India and the vast tracts of land, especially in the Aksai Chin area, occupied by China.
The Sino-India border dispute involving 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) remained unresolved. China also claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which India contests.
So far, the two countries held 21 rounds of Special Representatives talks to resolve the border dispute.
Besides the 1962 war, India and China had a major military standoff at Doklam in 2017 when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) tried to lay a road close to India"s narrow Chicken Neck corridor connecting with the North-Eastern states in an area also claimed by Bhutan.
It was finally diplomatically resolved after which both sides pulled back their troops.
China also had a major military conflict with Vietnam in 1979. China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.
"China has achieved full resolution of land border delimitation problems with 12 of its 14 neighbouring countries, and delineated the China-Vietnam maritime boundary in the Beibu Gulf," the white paper said, noting that since reform and opening up in 1978, the country has cut its armed forces "by over four million."
The two-million strong Chinese military still remain the world's largest.
Prolonged monsoon brings floods and chaos to many parts of India
India's monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing deaths from collapsing buildings and many crops beginning to rot.
Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal. If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.
Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.
Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall. Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.
The monsoon was also late to arrive. Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.
The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers. "This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year. It is making my vegetables - I've got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment - rot," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food. Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about £1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).
Festivals are also at risk. The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.
Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil. But given that the effigies are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana might have the last laugh.
Julian Assange: Private security firm 'spied on WikiLeaks founder in Ecuadorian embassy for CIA'
A Spanish private security company hired to protect the Ecuadorian embassy in London when Julian Assange lived there spied on the WikiLeaks founder for the US intelligence service, it has been claimed.
A report in Spanish newspaper El Pais said the company, UC Global SL, allegedly handed over audio and video to the CIA of meetings Assange held with his lawyers.
The company is being investigated over the claims by Spain's High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, said the report.
Assange filed a criminal complaint himself, in which he accused the company of violating his privacy and the secrecy of his client-attorney privileges.
El Pais said UC Global SL had failed to respond to requests for comment on the claims.
In April, Assange was dragged out of the embassy after being handed over to the British authorities by Ecuador.
He took refuge there in 2012 while on bail and facing extradition to Sweden over sex assault allegations, saying he feared extradition to the US if he left over the activities of WikiLeaks.
The US formally requested his extradition in June on 18 charges, including computer misuse and the unauthorised disclosure of national defence information.
He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.
He is now in Belmarsh prison in London after being jailed for violating bail conditions imposed over the Swedish extradition request and was due to be released last week, but was remanded in custody pending a hearing of the US extradition case in London in February 2020.
In May, Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation into an allegation of rape against Assange - an allegation he has always denied.
Omni Air flight lands in Baltimore after declaring emergency
The Federal Aviation Administration says an Omni Air International jet landed safely at Baltimore Washington International Airport after declaring an emergency.
The FAA said in an email that Flight 328 landed at BWI at 6:19 p.m. on Thursday because of what was described as a hydraulic problem with the Boeing B777.
According to the FAA, the flight departed from Baltimore, but its destination wasn't known. It's unclear how many people were on board. The agency is investigating the incident.
A telephone message left at Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Omni Air International was immediately returned Thursday night.
Why we still need Gandhi
The leaders of the world's two largest democracies need to heed the principles of a remarkable man whose 150th birthday we are currently celebrating.
Mohandas Karamchand "Mahatma" Gandhi, who was born on Oct. 2, 1869, left a worldwide legacy with his focus on ethics, nonviolence, tolerance and social justice. He had a profound impact on two of the most important mass mobilizations in the United States.
The influence of Gandhi on the civil rights movement actually started well before the Rev. Martin Luther King's embrace of his ideals, with African-American activists such as Howard Thurman and Benjamin Mays undertaking long sea voyages to India to meet Gandhi.
And Cesar Chavez, who modeled many of his tactics on Gandhi's in leading the farmworkers" movement, traced his political awakening to a newsreel he watched at the age of 11 or 12 showing that "this half-naked man without a gun had conquered the might of the British Empire."
Outside the United States, Gandhi had a similar effect. Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize-winner Malala Yousafzai and climate change activists, to give just a few examples, have acknowledged Gandhi as a guiding light.
But President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who triumphantly addressed a joint mega-rally in Houston recently, seem to be impervious to Gandhi's ideas, despite paying lip service to him at the event. Both are right-wing populists who have ruled with scant compassion or tolerance, successfully mobilizing whites and Hindus in their respective countries as voting blocs, and fomenting division and social antagonism.
Modi has belonged, since he was 8 years old, to a Hindu nationalist organization known as the RSS, an ex-member of which, Nathuram Godse, assassinated Gandhi on Jan. 30, 1948. Indeed, parliamentarians from Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have heaped praise on Gandhi's killer in recent years.
The Modi government's un-Gandhian approach has manifested itself on many fronts. It has stripped the Muslim-majority province of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and statehood and put it into lockdown. It has proven unwelcoming to the mostly Muslim Rohingya refugees who have fled from extreme persecution in Myanmar.
And Modi's government has created an uproar by instituting a national registry of citizens and setting up detention camps in the border state of Assam to ostensibly catch noncitizens from neighboring Muslim-majority Bangladesh, a step that may end up disenfranchising and imprisoning almost 2 million people.
Trump is singing from a similar songbook. His administration's Muslim-majority travel ban echoes the Islamophobia that often informs Modi's policymaking. Its callousness toward refugees mirrors the Indian government's disdain for the Rohingya population's suffering, and its detention camps parallel the ones the Modi regime is setting up. Trump's stirring of racial animosity is analogous to troublesome rhetoric from a number of Modi's cabinet members.
There was a teachable moment for the two leaders at their recent joint rally. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer at the event quoted Gandhi's definition of democracy as "something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong."
Trump and Modi would do very well to keep Gandhi's advice in mind, 150 years after his birth.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor to be FEMA chief: White House
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Acting Administrator Peter Gaynor smiles as he testifies before a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on FEMA's FY2020 budget request on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 3, 2019.
U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.
Gaynor, FEMA's deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.
The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post. Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
A different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.
Gaynor's nomination to the post was expected. He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.
Before becoming FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said.
Man set alight on doorstep 'in targeted attack'
A man has been set alight on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old was soaked in flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, before bursting into flames outside his home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire.
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns.
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man's house at about 1am on Thursday.
Detective Chief Inspector Pauline Stables, leading the investigation, said: "This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital.
"We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible.
"While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened, we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time.
"Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
"Has a loved one come home acting suspiciously, smelling of smoke or petrol or with unexplained injuries?
"We need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime."
Vulnerable Dems air impeachment concerns to Pelosi
During the meeting, several members made clear their stance that Democrats should keep the inquiry focused on the Ukraine matter -- allegations that Trump asked the Ukrainian President to initiate an investigation into a potential 2020 political rival -- and not the other instances of potential wrongdoing detailed in the report from special counsel Robert Mueller.
Democrats are largely in agreement about the strategy, with Pelosi saying during her press conference on Thursday morning that the whistleblower complaint is "the focus of the moment."
By keeping the impeachment inquiry focused, leaders hope to keep the caucus unified -- with an eye to the moderate members who only recently joined calls for proceedings. The Ukraine matter is also relatively clear-cut and easy to explain to the public, lawmakers say. They also argue the probe, spearheaded by the intelligence committee, will be able to move faster -- possibly in the next month or two -- with a narrower scope.
Rep. Angie Craig, a vulnerable freshman Democrat from Minnesota, who said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment inquiry said after the meeting that Pelosi and Democratic leaders mostly listened to the views raised by the lawmakers.
"I'm in a district where I've been reluctant to move forward only from the perspective where I want to be disciplined, I want to look at due process and want to make sure we get all of our facts -- and this process will allow us to do that," Craig said, adding she backed a narrow probe led by the House Intelligence Committee.
Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, told CNN that he wouldn't -- at this point -- vote for articles of impeachment.
"I would vote no right now because we haven't seen all the facts," Cartwright said. "We have to presume that people are innocent, don't we, and we have to see if what the press has been reporting and what has been revealed in terms of documentation, if if all that is true."
Democrats will hear from constituents about their moves toward impeachment soon, with members scheduled to return to their districts for a two-week recess at the start of October. It will be the first time a swath of members from more conservative districts will receive clear, in-person feedback -- or, in some cases, blowback -- from the people they represent since they joined calls for impeachment proceedings in the wake of the Ukraine allegations earlier this week.
But Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, said the timing of the recess has its upsides.
"I really can't think of a better thing to do than to sort of check in with the boss before we move forward," he told reporters. "It's actually good timing that we get a chance to go home, catch our breath, get the perspective of people back home, explain what we're doing, and then come back and move forward accordingly."
Once lawmakers return, though, movement is likely to be quick.
"I think it's everybody's intention here to get this done in 2019," said Rep. Jamie Raskin, an impeachment advocate and member of the Judiciary Committee.
"The caucus is unified around the lawlessness and corruption pouring forth from the White House, and our job will be to reduce it to a set of articles of impeachment that make sense to the country," the Maryland Democrat told reporters on Thursday night. "We need a set of articles that make a compelling legal case and that tell a coherent story to the public. And if we do our job right, it will be a unifying exercise for the whole country."
Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a freshman from New York who has resisted calls for an impeachment probe, told CNN that he's "not yet" there on impeaching Trump.
"While I find many of the statements in the whistleblower's report disturbing, there's a lot more information that's out there," Brindisi said. "We have to talk to some of these officials that they have listed in the report here and see where it goes."
More than half the members of the US House of Representatives have said they support an impeachment inquiry, according to a CNN count. However, that count includes many Democrats who say they support an impeachment investigation but are still waiting for the results of the probe before deciding whether to finally vote to impeach Trump. Even if the House could pass the vote, it likely would go nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate, one of many reasons the issue has been politically divisive in the party.
Still there has been a surge in support -- more than 75 House members in about three days -- of launching such an inquiry as part of the fallout from Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky where he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.
Trump official says lawyers had Ukraine call transcript moved to secure system
A senior Trump administration official acknowledged Friday that White House lawyers directed moving the transcript of President Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to a highly secure system.
Other details about what efforts were taken to move the records are not immediately known, beyond the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint about that call.
The whistleblower complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, alleges that White House officials said they were "directed" by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept.
The whistleblower alleged that the transcript was kept on a different system normally used for classified information. The whistleblower also said that, according to White House officials, it was "not the first time" a presidential transcript was placed into this system in order to protect politically sensitive information and not national security-sensitive information. The complaint alleged that the White House tried to "restrict access" to records of the call.
"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to "lock down" all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced - as customary - by the White House Situation Room," the whistleblower stated.
The White House released an unclassified version of that transcript of the call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a "verbatim transcript" but is based on "notes and recollections" of those memorializing the call, shows Trump seeking assistance in investigating the Bidens.
"The other thing, there is a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great," he said. "Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it...sounds horrible to me."
This refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings - where his son, Hunter Biden, was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.
But the whistleblower's complaint alleges that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to help in the 2020 campaign. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that the concerns were based on second-hand information.
The White House lawyers" directive to move the transcript has been characterized by top Democrats as a "cover-up."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was prompted by Ukraine developments this week to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, called the move a "cover-up" and said it would be part of the impeachment inquiry.
Meanwhile, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow downplayed the importance of the record-keeping details.
"A cover-up? Think about that for a moment," Sekulow said on "Fox & Friends" Friday. "The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine? It's so secret and such a cover-up, here's the documents. This is nonsense."
Ukraine scandal: Pelosi says Barr 'rogue'; former U.S. officials back investigation
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused U.S. Attorney General William Barr Friday of going "rogue" to protect President Donald Trump over his controversial phone call with Ukraine's leader, which has led to an impeachment inquiry.
The California Democrat's words follow a release of the complaint Thursday, which was submitted by an unidentified intelligence official to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Atkinson turned it over to national intelligence director Joseph Maguire.
Barr is mentioned several times in the July 25 phone call, as is Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani. The complaint says White House officials were concerned enough that they attempted to "lock down" the record of the call.
"[Barr has] gone rogue," Pelosi told MSNBC Friday. "I think where they're going is a cover-up of a cover-up. I think it's sad, to have a Justice Department go so rogue. Well, they have been for a while. And now it just makes matters worse."
Pelosi announced an official impeachment investigation this week after Trump acknowledged he'd withheld military aid to Ukraine. The aid was ultimately granted, but House Democrats want to know whether there was any connection to the aid and Trump's asking Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for five years.
Also Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation. The coalition said Trump's actions constitute a "profound national security concern."
"We applaud those members of Congress, including Speaker Pelosi, who have started us down that necessary path," the letter states. "President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process. That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power.
"It would also represent an effort to subordinate America's national interests -- and those of our closest allies and partners -- to the president's personal political interest."
Trump has denied there was any impropriety with the phone call. Friday, he denounced the complainant and again said the call with Zelensky was a "perfect conversation"
"Sounding more and more like the so-called whistle-blower isn't a whistle-blower at all," he tweeted. "In addition, all second-hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?"
Vice President Mike Pence also had interactions with Ukrainian leaders, the whistle-blower complaint shows, and he met with Zelensky in Poland earlier this month. He said neither Joe Biden or Hunter Biden were discussed.
Death of Chinese activist in police custody prompts calls for investigation into torture
Human rights advocates are calling for an investigation into the death of a Chinese activist, arrested after holding up a placard calling for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to step down.
Wang Meiyu, 38, was detained in July after he stood outside the Hunan provincial police department holding a sign that called on Xi and Chinese premier Li Keqiang to resign and implement universal suffrage in China. He was later charged with "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," a vague offence often given to dissidents.
According to Wang's mother and lawyer, he died on Monday. Wang's wife Cao Shuxia received a call from police notifying her that her husband had died at a military hospital in the city of Hengyang where he had been held. The police officer on the phone did not offer any explanation of the cause of death.
According to Minsheng Guancha, a Chinese human rights group, Cao was later able to see Wang's body and saw he was bleeding from his eyes, mouth, ears and nose and there were bruises on his face.
"The Chinese government must investigate allegations of torture and the death in detention of human rights activist Wang Meiyu and hold the perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial killing criminally accountable," the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) said in a statement.
According to Radio Free Asia, Cao said police pressured her to accept their statement that Wang's death had been an accident but she refused. An officer at the Hengyang police station said he could not comment on the case. Wang's mother told the Guardian the family has been offered compensation of more than 2 million yuan (about $220,000).
"Giving compensation without an investigation or criminal accountability for the perpetrator is not true redress nor will it effectively prevent torture," said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at CHRD.
"Especially when a family has effectively been held hostage and thus likely coerced into giving up claims for investigation for the compensation."
Wang's death follows after those of other activists including grassroots lawyer Ji Sizun, who died in police custody in July, Uighur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim who died last year. Nobel laureate winner Liu Xiaobo who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11-year-prison sentence and activist Cao Shunli died in 2014, detained after attempting to attend a UN session on human rights in China.
Since Monday, Wang's family has been placed under house arrest, according to CHRD. He has two young children. Others connected to his case have also come under pressure. Late on Wednesday, six armed police detained Xie Yang, a rights lawyer, and Chen Yanhui, an activist, who had met at a hotel to discuss Wang's case. They were released on Thursday.
Wang, who began his work as an activist when his home was forcibly demolished, has been detained and claimed to have suffered torture before.
In 2018 after he held up the placard calling for Xi's resignation, he wrote online of how police stormed into his home, ordering him to write a confession letter and a statement promising he would stop.
"These idiots. They can't understand that even after these years of persecution, including being deprived of water for three days or suffering two hours of electrical needles that caused me to vomit blood, I won't surrender."
Pet owners who fail to walk their dogs face $2,700 fine
Owners can face heavy on-the-spot fines if they fail to provide basics like shelter, food and water. People who confine dogs for 24 hours must also allow them to move freely for the next two hours or face prosecution.
The territory is the first jurisdiction in Australia to recognize animal sentience.
"Modern animal welfare is about considering how an animal is coping both mentally and physically with the conditions in which it lives," ACT City Service Minister Chris Steel, who secured the bill, said in a media release.
Hong Kong police say student arrests at protests increase
Hong Kong police said Friday that students accounted for 29% of nearly 1,600 people detained in anti-democracy protests since June and urged young people to take the "straight and narrow path" as more major rallies are planned this weekend.
Police public relations chief Tse Chun-chung said 207 high school and university students were detained this month alone despite the resumption of classes after the summer holiday, compared to 257 over the June-August period.
He said there was a rise in teenagers participating in violent crimes, with some already charged in court. This included a 16-year-old charged recently with arson, which carries possible a life imprisonment upon conviction, a 13-year-old girl charged with desecrating Chinese flags and others with attacking police officers and carrying dangerous weapons.
"It is an alarming trend to us," he said at a news conference. "It is worrying to see these youths breaking the law and possibly having criminal records at such a young and tender age. We appeal to all youngsters to rethink their actions and hope the education sector and parents will help our young people to walk the straight and narrow path."
Young people have largely led the protests that started in June over an extradition bill that the government has now agreed to withdraw. But the movement has since drawn wider participation as it snowballed into a wider anti-China campaign against what protesters say is Beijing's creeping intrusion into Hong Kong's autonomy promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city's leaders and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality against protesters.
Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest at a downtown square Friday night against alleged abuse of power by police, waving anti-police banners and chanting pro-democracy slogans. The government has said complaints against police will be examined by a police watchdog agency that critics say is toothless and has no real investigative powers.
Police have approved a major rally in downtown Hong Kong on Saturday organized by the Civil Human Rights Front to mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the Umbrella Revolution, when protesters occupied key thoroughfares in the city for 79 days in 2014 to demand universal suffrage. That movement ended without any government concession.
Protesters are also organizing "anti-totalitarianism" rallies in Hong Kong and many cities worldwide on Sunday against what they denounced as China's tyranny.
Tse appealed to protesters to stop hijacking peaceful protests, like what happened in previous rallies when some lobbed gasoline bombs, set off street fires and vandalized public utilities. Police have responded with tear gas, water cannons, and other measures, prompting complaints from protesters that they are using excessive force.
The Civil Human Rights Front is also planning another big march on Oct. 1, sparking fears of a bloody showdown that could embarrass China's ruling Communist Party as it marks its 70th year in power with grand festivities in Beijing. The Hong Kong government has scaled down National Day celebrations by calling off an annual firework display and moving a reception indoors.
Nestle tightens controls on coffee beans after weedkiller scare
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.
Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup. In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate. Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys. Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG. It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.
Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said. "This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls," the spokesperson told CNN Business. Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin.
Nestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil, since these countries are among the world's biggest coffee producers.
"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.
Brands such as Nescafe and Nespresso make up a sizable chunk of Nestle's powdered and liquid beverages business, which generated sales of 21.6 billion Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) in 2018. Nestle last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks' packaged coffees and teas around the world.
Does glyphosate cause cancer?
Glyphosate is used on more than 100 food crops, according to the EPA. Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children.
Still, the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks. Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance, the EPA said in a statement in April.
But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer.
Earlier this year, a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup, used on their property for more than three decades, had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other. Bayer is contesting the verdict.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate was "probably carcinogenic to humans," based on "limited" evidence of cancer in humans and "sufficient" evidence of cancer in experimental animals. However, a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet.
Man guilty of killing 6 members of his extended family in Texas
A Utah man was convicted Thursday of killing six members of his extended family in Texas and faces the possibility of a death sentence.
A Harris County jury found Ronald Haskell, 39, guilty in the July 2014 killings of six members of the Stay family: parents Stephen Stay and Katie Stay, and children Bryan, 13, Emily, 9, Rebecca, 7 and Zach, 4.
"We are grateful for the jurors' rapt attention over the last many weeks to every piece of evidence in the case," Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement. "There was never a reasonable doubt that Haskell meticulously planned and carried out the slaughter of the Stay family."
Police have said that Haskell traveled from California to the Houston suburb of Spring and ambushed his ex-wife's sister, her husband and their five children in their home.
The Stays and four of their children were fatally shot in the back of their heads, and a fifth child, who was 15 at the time, survived. That teen, Cassidy, was grazed in the head by a bullet and played dead.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the capital murder case, but jurors will decide whether Haskell should receive a death sentence or life in prison.
At trial, the defense argued that Haskell was insane and heard voices that led him to kill the six people, NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston reported. After the verdict was read Thursday, he hung his head.
"I think he took it as best as you could expect," said Doug Durham, one of Haskell's defense attorneys, according to the station. "He was aware that this was a strong possibility."
The sentencing phase begins Monday. Haskell defense attorney Neil Davis III said his team will work "to save his life. That's our job," according to KPRC.
The sentencing phase is expected to last around 2 ½ weeks, the station reported.
Cassidy testified at the trial and was surrounded by family members. She appeared to be praying before the guilty verdict was read Thursday, according to KPRC.
At a 2014 memorial for her family, Cassidy thanked the community for its support and said that she was comforted knowing her parents, two brothers and two sisters are "in a much better place, and that I'll be able to see them again one day."
Haskell was disguised as a FedEx delivery driver when he went to the Stay home, apparently looking for his ex-wife, who is Katie Stay's sister.
He forced his way inside and tied up Cassidy, officials said. When the rest of her family returned minutes later, Haskell tied them up and demanded to know the whereabouts of his ex-wife. They said they didn't know, and they were each shot in the back of the head.
Cassidy, who was wounded, played dead until Haskell left, and was able to identify him to police. She told officials he was planning to drive to her grandparents' home and kill them. But police tracked down Haskell, and he was arrested after a 20-minute police chase and a three-hour standoff.
US deaths could result in Scottish ban on vaping and e-cigarette ads
A BAN on advertising for e-cigarettes and vaping products, is being considered by ministers.
The First Minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in "the coming months."
Nicola Sturgeon says that if evidence supports further moves over the sale of such products her Government would "not hesitate" to act.
It comes as it emerged a vaping-related illness had claimed two more lives, bringing the total number of fatalities to 11.
Vaping - which involves inhaling a mix typically made of nicotine, water, solvents and flavours - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit, but its safety is still not entirely known.
But in the US, more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking e-cigarettes. Officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone.
The first deaths in Florida and Georgia were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday. Currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness, with lives lost in eight states.
While most patients have reported a history of using products containing THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, the patient who died in Georgia on Wednesday reported only "heavy nicotine vaping."
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mystery illness, and has warned citizens against smoking e-cigarette products until more is known, particularly if modified or bought "off the street."
The First Minister has confirmed the Scottish Government was monitorigin developments in the US and elsewhere "closely," following the loss of life that has been attributed to vaping.
She pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vaping being reported in Europe.
"Our approach has been a precautionary one, which is why in Scotland we have already taken the strictest regulatory approach in Europe to vapour products," she said.
"The European tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful.
"The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e-liquids.
"In Scotland, we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations.
"In the coming months, we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vapour products."
She added: "It is important to stress, and for all of us to remember, that those devices are relatively new and, therefore, their impact continues to be studied. We do not yet fully understand what that impact is, which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious.
"That is perhaps a reason why e-cigarette use remains relatively low in Scotland.
"We remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm.
"While we already have among the strictest regimes on those products, if the evidence shows that further action is needed... we will not hesitate to take it."
Cambodian court charges exiled politicians with rebellion
A Cambodian court has charged seven top opposition politicians with plotting armed rebellion for planning to return from self-imposed exile to seek a change in government through mass peaceful protests.
The Phnom Penh Municipal Court also warned that anyone who supported the plans of the Cambodia National Rescue Party to oust the government would also be risking a long prison term.
The returning party chiefs could be sent to prison for 15 to 30 years if found guilty, and their supporters could be sentenced to five to 10 years. Even attending a rally or expressing support online could be considered plotting to topple the government, Justice Ministry spokesman Chin Malin was quoted as saying.
The court's charges on Thursday are the latest salvo in a political battle that has heated up since opposition leader Sam Rainsy announced plans to return from more than three years of exile on Nov. 9 to seek a "restoration of democracy."
Nov. 9 is Cambodia's independence day, celebrating when it obtained its freedom from France in 1953.
"My calls to the people and the armed forces of #Cambodia to rise up against the regime will continue until the regime has restored to the opposition its right to participate in the country's political life including genuine elections," Sam Rainsy said on Twitter earlier this week.
His opposition party was dissolved by the courts ahead of last year's general election, ensuring that an increasingly authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen continued his four decades in power.
The party had been expected to mount a strong challenge in the July 2018 election, and its dissolution was widely seen as being politically motivated, with Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party fearful that it could lose power in the polls.
Hun Sen's government seems unnerved by the planned return of opposition politicians, though the effort appears to be a quixotic one, with Sam Rainsy calling on Cambodian workers in Thailand to accompany him home in massive numbers.
Officials have vowed to arrest Sam Rainsy on his arrival, but there is speculation that Cambodia may simply bar him from entry, which could even keep him from boarding a plane to the country if airlines are officially informed of such a ban. Neighboring countries are also unlikely to allow him to enter from their territory.
However, the government has stepped up arrests of his supporters and there are reports of recent physical attacks on opposition organizers.
Sam Rainsy went into exile in late 2015 to avoid a two-year prison sentence on charges of criminal defamation. Other legal cases have since been lodged against him by the government.
Other top party members fled into exile during a late 2017 crackdown on all opposition to Hun Sen, which included the arrest of the party's co-founder, Kem Sokha. He was charged with treason, based on his links to a U.S. pro-democracy organization, and is under strict house arrest.
This year's Turner Prize-shortlisted pieces will be on display in Margate from tomorrow, with Brexit on the agenda.
Colombian artist Oscar Murillo's work "surge (social cataracts) " depicts people staring out to the North Sea, but with their view of the water and the European continent on the other side of it obscured by a dark canvas, with only a sliver of what lies beyond revealed through a slash in the canvas.
The work is one of four shortlisted entries to the prestigious and often contentious annual art prize, founded in 1984 and given to an artist residing in Britain or British-born but living elsewhere.
Curator Fiona Parry explains that Murillo's work focuses on the current political and socio-economic situation in the UK. The group of papier-mâché figures represent a globalised workforce, while the black cloth represents the "darkness of the contemporary moment in the UK and globally."
She added: "I think it's a broader idea of blocking the view, the outward-looking view, to anywhere really. And that gesture of blocking the light. But I guess there is still this sort of glimmer of hope, there is a slash in the canvas, and you can just see the sea on the horizon."
Helen Cammock's video piece A Long Note, meanwhile, examines the overlooked role of women in the civil rights movement in Derry/Londonderry, Northern Ireland that began in 1968. The work also connects to broader global class, race and gender struggles during the late 1960s.
All works will be exhibited at Margate's Turner Contemporary gallery, from 28 September to 12 January 2020, and the winner of the Turner Prize 2019 will be announced at a ceremony on 3 December.
Named after 19th-century landscape painter JMW Turner, the award made stars of Grayson Perry, Damien Hirst and 12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen.
Man pleads guilty in kidnap, torture plot of plastic surgeon
A Florida man has pleaded guilty to kidnapping a plastic surgeon who was tortured with a blowtorch in an extortion attempt.
The Sun Sentinel reports 34-year-old Justin Boccio pleaded guilty Thursday to kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the January attack on the surgeon, who hasn't been publicly identified.
Boccio's attorney, Kenneth Lange, said his client was convinced to take part in the scheme by co-defendant, Serge Nkorina, who's being extradited from Tenerife, Spain.
Court documents say the surgeon was leaving a Walmart store when he was confronted by an armed man and shoved into a van. They say he was tortured for hours before being returned to his car while unconscious. Surveillance video supports the chain of events. Investigators say Nkorina's wife was a client of the surgeon.
UK parliament rejects second bid for early election
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been dealt another blow in his push for an early election in the United Kingdom.
The House of Commons speaker says under current rules it will not be possible to go to the polls before October 31 - the day Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union.
Parliament has met for the second day since the Supreme Court ruled its suspension as unlawful.
Meanwhile, the EU's lead negotiator, Michael Barnier, says the bloc is still waiting for new plans from the UK.
US sends troops, air defense systems to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran attacks
The U.S. is sending a Patriot missile battery, four ground-based radar systems, and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia to deter Iran's increasingly aggressive behavior, officials announced Thursday.
A THAAD missile defense system and two additional Patriot missile batteries are prepared to go if needed, the Pentagon said.
"Other countries have called out Iranian misadventures in the region, and we look for them to contribute assets in an international effort to reinforce Saudi Arabia's defense," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.
Last week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said more troops would deploy to the Middle East as a "defensive" measure to help protect against attacks from Iran.
Esper said the deployment was a first step toward addressing Iran's increasingly violent acts in the region -- including this month's drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities -- and he called on other nations to step up and condemn the attacks.
Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Sept. 14 attack on the world's largest oil processing plant and a major oil field, but the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran directly. Iran has denied involvement in the attack.
"It is clear [...] that the weapons used were Iranian-produced and were not launched from Yemen," Esper said Friday, noting that all signs indicate "Iran was responsible for the attack."
The purpose of deploying troops and resources is to "send a clear message that the United States supports our partners" and provide a "free flow of resources," Esper said.
The U.S. calls on other countries to also "stand up and condemn the attacks," as well as contribute capabilities, the secretary said.
Meghan Markle was 'never asked' about Suits cameo
The creator of Suits, Aaron Korsh, has said he "never asked" Britain's Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, to reprise her role as Rachel Zane for a cameo in the show's last-ever episode.
In an interview with Deadline.com following the airing of Suits' finale in the US, Korsh was asked if there was "any possibility" of the former actress being asked "to do even a small cameo."
"Now that we already did it, I will tell you," Korsh replied.
"I thought about asking, and I thought about even using audio footage - that we have to come up with something - and in the end I didn't ask, and I just thought, 'I'm going to respect her new life and not put her in the position of having to ask'.
"We decided not to put her in that position so I never asked."
The Duchess of Sussex appeared in archive Suits footage during the finale's montage.
She starred as Rachel Zane in the New York-set legal drama from 2011 until her final episode aired last year.
In the final series, Rachel's onscreen husband Mike Ross, played by Patrick J Adams, paid a visit from Seattle and was asked how Rachel was getting on.
"If I told you how good, you probably wouldn't believe me," he replied.
Pit bull dies of snake bites while protecting Florida boys
A man in Florida says his family's 8-month-old pit bull Zeus died of snake bites as it was trying to protect his sons.
Gary Richardson told WOFL-TV the boys were outside the family's home in Sumter County, Florida, on Monday, cleaning Zeus' water dish when the venomous coral snake slithered toward them. Richardson says the children didn't see the snake but the dog did and attacked it.
Richardson says the snake bit Zeus four times. The dog was rushed to a veterinarian but he died a day after the attack.
Germany reports landmark case of West Nile virus
Authorities are reporting the first known human case of West Nile virus transmitted by mosquitoes in Germany, a development apparently hastened by climate change.
The national disease control and tropical medicine centers said Friday the person developed encephalitis but recovered after hospital treatment.
The virus originated in Africa but has been spread northward by migratory birds and mosquitoes. There have been several outbreaks in southern and central Europe in recent years. It is found in much of the U.S.
Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of Germany's Bernhard Nocht Institute tropical medicine center said that "the unusually warm summers of the last two years, triggered by climate change, apparently have contributed to WNV establishing itself north of the Alps."
The virus causes dangerous meningitis or encephalitis in less than 1% of those infected.
Men undergoing surgery for prostate cancer fare as well without radiotherapy
Men undergoing surgery for prostate cancer fare just as well without radiotherapy, a major study has found.
The findings, from the the largest ever trial examining those having surgery for the disease, could spare thousands from gruelling treatment which can have distressing side-effects.
The Royal Marsden study involved 1,400 men being treated for prostate cancer.
Half were given immediate radiotherapy, which until now has been standard treatment to prevent the return of disease. The rest were monitored and only given radiotherapy if there were signs that disease had returned.
Scientists found that five years later, there was almost no difference in disease recurrence between the two groups, with those who did not have treatment faring slightly better.
Progression free survival was 85 per cent in the radiotherapy group and 88 per cent in the standard care group.
There was a difference of around 1 per cent between the groups, after data was adjusted to take account of other factors.
The study, funded by Cancer Research UK, found those who had radiotherapy were twice as likely to suffer a worsening of urinary incontinence, one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.
One year after surgery 5.3 per cent of patients receiving radiotherapy suffered a deterioration, compared to 2.7 per cent who had standard care.
Seth Dunlap Louisiana: WWL Radio host threatening to sue over anti-gay tweet sent the tweet himself, station claims, similar to Jussie Smollett case
A radio host in New Orleans said he received an anti-gay slur, sent to him from the radio station's Twitter account. On Wednesday, WWL host Seth Dunlap, who is openly gay, said he planned to sue the station's parent company after working for years in a homophobic and hostile workplace. In a strange turn of events Thursday, the New Orleans Police Department said the homophobic tweet sent to Dunlap came from none other than Dunlap's phone.
The tweet in question was sent earlier this month and the day it was sent, Dunlap hosted his show as usual. But the next day, he announced a leave of absence, CBS affiliate WWL-TV reports.
In a statement, Dunlap said 14 people had access WWL's Twitter account. He claimed he was not one of the people with access to the account.
However, he decided to take a polygraph test to dispel any speculation that he was the one who sent the tweet to himself, his lawyer Megan Kiefer, said. A lawsuit has not yet been filed on Dunlap's behalf, but he said in his statement that one would be coming, according to WWL-TV.
WWL Radio, which is a CBS News Radio affiliate but is owned by Entercom, said in a statement it had investigated the tweet and decided to refer the matter to law enforcement officials. "WWL has completed its investigation into the highly offensive, unauthorized tweet sent from WWL's Twitter account on September 10, which directed a homophobic slur at Seth Dunlap," said WWL Radio in a statement.
"We determined that the most appropriate next step is to involve law enforcement. At this point, the investigation is in the hands of law enforcement and it is not appropriate for us to comment any further on the substance of our findings," the statement continue.
The New Orleans Police Department opened their investigation into the tweet and in a police report Thursday revealed a twist in the story: The homophobic slur was allegedly sent from Dunlap's personal cellphone.
Radio host Seth Dunlap claimed he worked in a homophobic and hostile workplace for years. After allegedly receiving a tweet with an anti-gay slur from the radio station's Twitter, he threatened to sue.
WWL accused Dunlap of threatening the station for money, NOLA.com reports. WWL alleged the 35-year-old radio host said he would "scorch the earth" over the tweet and then demanded over $1.8 million in compensation. According to a police report obtained by NOLA.com, WWL said Dunlap made this threat when he was facing personal financial issues.
The allegations were made by WWL's senior vice president Kevin Cassidy and attorneys for the parent company, Entercom. The police department is still working to corroborate the allegations, but have classified the case as possible extortion. In the state of Louisiana, extortion is defined as "the communication of threats to another with the intention (to) obtain anything of value."
Viola Davis discusses playing Michelle Obama in 'First Ladies'
Viola Davis says she's "terrified" to portray Michelle Obama in a new TV series.
The 54-year-old actress discussed playing Obama in the Showtime series First Ladies during Thursday's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!
Davis said she's met Obama but has no idea if the former first lady knows about her taking on the role.
"I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified," Davis said. "I don't care what else I've done in my life -- I've won an Emmy, I've won an Oscar, two Tonys -- but if I mess this up, this is going to be a defining moment in my life."
"It's like, 'You raised a great kid, but you messed up Michelle Obama,'" she jokingly added.
Davis said, however, that she's confident about the script, written by author Aaron Cooley. Davis and Cooley will also executive produce the show.
"It's going to be a great script, I promise," Davis said. "Listen, I don't want to make my people mad."
First Ladies will explore the political and personal lives of first ladies throughout U.S. history. The first season will focus on Obama, Eleanor Roosevelt and Betty Ford.
In addition to First Ladies, Davis will reunite with Denzel Washington, her Antwone Fisher and Fences co-star, in a Netflix adaptation of Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.
"I had to wear a fat suit," Davis told host Jimmy Kimmel. "I loved it. I told them that I wanted really, really big [expletive]. I wanted to look like the women I grew up with."
Davis plays Annalise Keating on the ABC series How to Get Away with Murder, which premiered its sixth and final season Thursday.
Mac Miller death: Third man charged with drug offences
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with the overdose death of rapper Mac Miller.
Steven Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that Miller possessed before he died of an accidental overdose last year of cocaine, alcohol and the powerful opioid.
Walter is accused of being the source of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
Ryan Reavis, 36, who was arrested in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, this week is accused of serving as Walter's "runner," who delivered the pills to Pettit.
Walter, who is on supervised release over a 2005 drug case, remains in custody.
A Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, Miller's lyrics included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.
He was also in a two-year relationship with Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018. After his death she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, Thank U Next, that lovingly mentioned him.
Miller was one of several musicians whose deaths have been linked in recent years to a national wave of opioid abuse and overdoses.
Prince died in 2016 when he took counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl that looked like a generic version of the painkiller Vicodin.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016, and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.
Woman STRIPS TO NOTHING in Walmart to prove she didn't steal
A woman accused of shoplifting at a Walmart in Mexico City took drastic measures to prove her innocence, stripping stark naked in the middle of the supermarket as a stunned security guard looked on.
In a video of the incident, filmed at the Tepeyac Walmart branch in Mexico City earlier this week, a security guard can be seen approaching a woman apparently suspected of theft as she neared the store's exit. Her reaction once she was stopped, however, left the watchman speechless.
The woman first peels off her skirt and begins to proceed toward the exit, but, perhaps unsatisfied her guilt was yet assuaged, soon turned around to remove her shirt as well. Now fully nude, she stormed off, clothes in hand.
The birthday-suited shopper's identity remains unknown, though she appears to have been allowed to leave the premises after the impromptu peep show.
Similar bizarre sights are nothing new for Walmart. In July, security cameras caught a Pennsylvania woman relieving herself into a bin of potatoes at a Walmart in the town of West Mifflin. The woman, who is visibly intoxicated in the footage, was charged with open lewdness, public drunkenness, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct for the deed, and became a viral sensation to boot.
In another case of compelled supermarket nudity this week, a British man, Steve Whitehurst, was forced to expose himself to security guards after they spotted a mysterious "bulge" in his pants. He hadn't stolen anything.
"I can't help the way I'm made," Whitehurst told the Sun.
West Bengal Government Plans To Set Up Museum At Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's House
Kolkata:
West Bengal government has plans to set up a museum at the north Kolkata house of 19th century social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar where he had spent the last few years of his life, state minister Partha Chatterjee said.
The museum will come up at Vidyasagar's residence at Badur Bagan area where pictures and models, chronicling his life from his birth place at Birsinghapur village in Paschim Medinipur district to the house in north Kolkata, will be put on display, he said on Thursday.
Mr Chatterjee, who is the education minister, said this at a function after inaugurating "Vidyasagar Academy" at the Badur Bagan residence on the 200th birth anniversary celebrations of the educational and social reformer.
The minister also released two books, "Amader Vidyasagar" and "Chotoder Vidyasagar" at the programme.
Some items used by Vidyasagar, gathering dust in the storeroom of the house, will be brought out for public viewing at the museum.
This will help the present generation to know about the man, who had waged a war against women oppression and propagated widow remarriage, he said.
The School Education and Higher Education department will organise seminars highlighting Vidaysagar's life and work in schools and colleges during a year-long programme, Mr Chatterjee said.
Listing other activities to be taken up by the academy, Mr Chatterjee said that a collection of hitherto unknown writings by Vidyasagar will be published.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had recently announced that Vidyasagar's birthplace at Birsinghapur village will be developed as an educational tourist hub.
On Thursday, a bronze statue of Vidyasagar was installed at Vidyasagar College.
"Those who are against the social reforms of Vidyasagar had vandalised his bust at the institution associated with his name," the minister said.
A bust of the social reformer was vandalised during a road show of BJP chief Amit Shah in the city in May.
On Monday, scientists from the Stanford University School of Medicine announced the invention of a new diagnostic tool that can sort cells by type: a tiny printable chip that can be manufactured using standard inkjet printers for possibly about one U.S. cent each.
Lead researchers say this may bring early detection of cancer, tuberculosis, HIV and malaria to patients in low-income countries, where the survival rates for illnesses such as breast cancer can be half those of richer countries.

The PBS show has more than two-dozen Emmy awards, and its run is shorter only than Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.
Each episode of the show would focus on a theme in a specific book and then explore that theme through multiple stories.
Each show would also provide recommendations for books that children should look for when they went to their library.
John Grant, from WNED Buffalo (Reading Rainbow's home station) said "Reading Rainbow taught kids why to read,... the love of reading — [the show] encouraged kids to pick up a book and to read."
It is believed by some, including John Grant, that both the funding crunch and a shift in the philosophy of educational television programming contributed to ending the series.

Jonny Reid, co-driver for the A1GP New Zealand team, today made history by driving the fastest over the 48-year-old Auckland Harbour Bridge, New Zealand, legally.
Mr Reid managed to drive the New Zealand's A1GP car, Black Beauty at speeds over 160km/h seven times over the bridge.
The New Zealand police had trouble using their speed radar guns to see how fast Mr Reid was going because of how low Black Beauty is, and the only time the police managed to clock Mr Reid was when he slowed down to 160km/h.
In the last 3 months, over 80 arrestees were released from the Central Booking facility without being formally charged.
In April this year, a temporary restaining order was issued by Judge Glynn against the facility to enforce the release of those held more than 24 hours after their intake who did not receive a hearing by a court commissioner.
The commissioner sets bail, if granted, and formalizes the charges filed by the arresting officer. The charges are then entered into the state's computer system where the case is tracked.
The hearing also marks the date for the suspect’s right to a speedy trial.

Brazil is the largest Roman Catholic country on Earth, and the Roman Catholic Church has consistently opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in the country.
The National Congress of Brazil has debated legalization for 10 years, and such civil marriages are currently only legal in Rio Grande do Sul.
The original bill was drafted by former mayor of São Paulo, Marta Suplicy. The proposed legislation, after being amended, is now in the hands of Roberto Jefferson.
Protesters hope to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November.
After it became apparent that many families were seeking legal help to fight the evictions, a meeting was held on March 20 at the East Bay Community Law Center for the victims of the housing scam.
When the tenants started sharing what had occurred to them, most of the families involved suddenly realized that Carolyn Wilson of the OHA had stolen their security deposits, and skipped out of town.
Tenants at Lockwood Gardens believe that there may be another 40 families or more to face eviction, since they learned that OHA police are also investigating other public housing properties in Oakland that may be caught up in the housing scam.

800 miles of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were closed down following a spill of thousands of barrels of crude oil south of Fairbanks, Alaska.
A power failure following a routine fire-command system test caused relief valves to open and crude oil overflowed near the Fort Greely pump station 9.
The valves opening allowed a pressure release for the system and oil flowed on a pad to a tank that can hold 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons).
As of Wednesday afternoon, the tank vents were still leaking probably from thermal expansion inside the tank.
Another secondary containment area below the tanks capable of holding 104,500 barrels was not yet filled to capacity.
The comments, live on television, were the first time that senior Iranian sources have admitted that the sanctions are having any effect.
They include financial restrictions and a ban by the European Union on the export of crude oil, from which the Iranian economy receives 80% of its foreign income.
In its most recent monthly report, OPEC said exports of crude had fallen to their lowest level for two decades at 2.8 million barrels per day.
The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has described the dependency on oil as "a trap" dating from before Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979 and from which the country should free itself.

Long before The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, Heck and Johnson envisioned a publication that would parody the news—and news reporting—when they were students at UW in 1988.
Since its inception, The Onion has become a veritable news parody empire, with a print edition, a website that drew 5,000,000 unique visitors in the month of October, personal ads, a 24 hour news network, podcasts, and a recently launched world atlas called Our Dumb World.
Al Gore and General Tommy Franks casually rattle off their favorite headlines (Gore's was when The Onion reported he and Tipper were having the best sex of their lives after his 2000 Electoral College defeat).
Many of their writers have gone on to wield great influence on Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's news parody shows.

Red tide is caused by a higher than normal concentration of Karenia brevis, a naturally-occurring single-celled marine organism.
Natural factors can intersect to produce ideal conditions, allowing this algae to increase in number dramatically.
The algae produces a neurotoxin that can disable nerves in both humans and fish.
Fish often die because of the high concentrations of the toxin in the waters.
Humans can be affected by breathing affected water taken into the air by wind and waves.

The Northern Rock bank had been nationalised in 2008 following the revelation that the company had received emergency support from the UK Government.
Northern Rock had required support due to its exposure during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007.
Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group had a bid for the bank rejected prior to the bank’s nationalisation.
In 2010, while nationalised, the current high street bank Northern Rock plc was split from the ‘bad bank’, Northern Rock (Asset Management).

This is believed to be the fifth time in history that people have observed what turned out to be chemically confirmed martian material falling to Earth.
Out of the approximately 24,000 known meteorites to have fallen to Earth, only about 34 have been verified to be martian in origin.
Fifteen of these rocks are attributed to the meteorite shower last July.
Some of the rocks, which are very rare on Earth, are being sold from US$11,000 to $22,500 per ounce, which is about ten times more than the cost of gold.

Dr. Lee also expressed his concern about reports that children in Turkey have now become infected with the A(H5N1) avian influenza virus without becoming ill.
Some studies suggest that the disease must become less lethal before it can cause a global epidemic, he noted.
There is concern that patients may continue to infect more people by going through their daily routines if the flu symptoms remain mild.
Leslie Aun, a spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, said the organization adopted a new rule that does not allow grants or funding to be awarded to organizations that are under legal investigation.
Komen's policy disqualified Planned Parenthood due to a pending investigation on how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money that is being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns.
Stearns is investigating whether taxes are used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood in his role as chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which is under the umbrella of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

"The CCTV would certainly send a strong signal to those people working with animals that their welfare is of the highest priority."
The United States Geological Survey international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland in the week prior.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the past 48 hours.
The significant earthquake activity resulting in the phase change had took place on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's summit caldera.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity were reported at the base of the mountain.
The clouds presented the potential for confusion as to whether an actual eruption had taken place.

China's GDP could be larger than the United States within two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is far from landfall, it remains difficult to assess potential impact to the United States or Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, Bobek gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.

"Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene, as people tried to break windows in order to get out.
People were hitting the panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
One of the panes finally broke, and they started to get out by the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused) together to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can make energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very hard problem to solve and will take many years before we see useful fusion reactors built.
The steel needle floats on top of the water because of surface tension.
Surface tension happens because the water molecules at the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than they are to the air molecules above them.
The water molecules make an invisible skin on the water’s surface that allows things like the needle to float on top of the water.
The blade on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hollow between them. The two edges allow for a better grasp of the ice, even when tilted.
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, as the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge which is in contact with the ice also curves.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, in reality photons are a lot smaller than those in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that makes up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.
The light bulb then needs replacing. It is necessary to be careful in replacing the light bulb.
First, the switch for the light fixture needs to be turned off or the cable disconnected.
This is because electricity flowing into the socket where the metallic part of bulb sits can give you a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partly in the socket.
The major organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood goes away from the heart in tubes called arteries and comes back to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
A triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but even very tough branches and roots.
Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves.
A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How would Io's gravity pull on me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you.
The Sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth that you can stand on. The whole Sun is made out of gases, fire, and plasma.
The gas becomes thinner as you go farther from the center of the Sun.
The outer-part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.
Phases happen because only the side of Venus (or of the Moon) facing the Sun is lighted. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw.
However in 991 Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum's a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to reclaim his country from Danish domination.
After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed success.
Hangeul is the only purposely invented alphabet in popular daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 – 1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most highly regarded.
He originally named the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the correct sounds for the instruction of the people".
There are many theories to how Sanskrit came into existence. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the west into India who brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, Sanskrit just faded due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages, just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish.
With the battle for France over, Germany began to get ready to invade the island of Britain.
Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was fairly weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.
Let's start with an explanation about Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war.
Italy's main goals were African countries. To capture those countries, they would need to have a troop launching pad, so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides those actions, Italy's battleships were not supposed to do anything else.
Now for Japan. Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater, and remain there for an extended amount of time.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.
German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the war Germans aren't trusted to have many of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "The Boy King", is one of the most well known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most ancient king lists.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs of the past were robbed, this tomb was left virtually undisturbed.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artefacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spoke wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. About 1000 B.C., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. Possibly the most known person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is a mathematician Pythagoras, mostly known for his famous theorem about relations of the sides of right triangles.
There are varying estimates for how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not very closely related dialects are counted.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in script; in everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people, so they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet and one character "Õ/õ" was added.
As time passed, many words that were borrowed from German coalesced. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school.
However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History, earning a 2:2 (a lower second class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.
European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula) includes 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Turkey's area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are in south west Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.
Turkey's area makes it the world's 37th-largest country, and is about the size of Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is encircled by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence dates from 1839.
Present-day parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past but became Belgian after the 1830s Belgian Revolution.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but it was occupied in both World War I and World War II by Germany.
In 1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization which is today known as the European Union.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro District (in Phondey Village).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951, a fire caused for only some of the relics of the Drukgyal Dzong to remain, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining to be one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
During the 18th century Cambodia found itself squeezed between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the last years of the 18th century the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who are employed work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, where the country is a net exporter, even though only one percent work in the oil industry.
Early in the nation's independence, Singapore Botanic Gardens' expertise helped to transform the island into a tropical Garden City.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the nation's national flower.
Every year around October nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel towards the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills for the rains.
And then back to the north through the west, once again crossing the Mara river, after the rains in around April.

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, story telling, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you re-assess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires that components of a project connect to each other, but also make sense as a separate entity.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than for prime lenses.
This is becoming less of an issue as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This has allowed zoom lenses to produce pictures of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes inexpensive zoom lenses hard to use in low-light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is the overscan.
Most televisions are made in a way to please the general public.
For that reason, everything you see on the TV had the borders cut, top, bottom and sides.
This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. That is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, it's borders will most likely be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't be fully shown.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, conjuring up images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even standing amidst thousand year-old ruins it is easy to bring to mind the sounds and smells of battles long gone, to almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobbles and to smell the fear rising from the dungeon pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Typical for the period, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a true castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long.
In the 1480s, when its construction was begun by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only required against small bands of roving marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and thus national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance.
The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of being religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be labeled a religious war.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE in an act of arson committed by Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The Ephesians, outraged, announced that Herostratus' name never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, which is how we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was denied. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly - also try not to make much extraneous motion with your fingers.
This way, you will tire yourself out as little as possible. Remember there's no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on the piano.
On the accordion, to get extra volume, you use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/the deity or dieties.
Followers pursue certain ways of living, or practices that are intended to nurture those experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, particularly those of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian sub-continent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism though they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi for "way of the guru". The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions but in Sikhism has taken on an importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). There followed in succession a further nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers were protesting against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against Communism.
Although in the end, Krushchev sent in tanks to restore order, he did give way to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwest Indian subcontinent encompassing most of modern-day Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
The civilisation flourished in the basins of the Indus River wherefore it derives its name.
Although some scholars speculate that since the civilisation also existed in the basins of the now dried up Sarasvati River, it should be aptly called the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, while some call it the Harappan Civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman empire aided in the development of medical advances.
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps for use in the aftermath of battles.
Surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine from herbane seeds.
They became proficient at amputation to save patients from gangrene as well as tourniquets and arterial clamps to stem blood flow.
Over multiple centuries, the Roman empire led to great gains in the field of medicine and formed much of the knowledge we know today.
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that only one fold may be done at a time, more complex folds like reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have straightforward locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes quite young and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For instance, children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as not doing well in school tend to not do well in school once they learn about the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and has 54 million profiles currently.
These websites have gotten a lot of attention, especially in the education setting.
There are positive aspects to these websites, which include, being able to easily setup a class page which can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page can easily be accessed by providing just one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.
It can be customized to make it easy to read and also with as much or little color as desired.
Attention Deficit Disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms including impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity or excess energy".
It is not a learning disability, it is a learning disorder; it "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children".
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school work, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy doing like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble, because they "engage in risky behaviors, get into fights, and challenge authority" in order to stimulate their brain, since their brain can not be stimulated by normal methods.
ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children can not understand why they act the way that they do or why they spell they way they do or that their maturity level is different.
As the ability to obtain knowledge and to learn changed in such a way as mentioned above the base rate at which knowledge was obtained changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. No longer did pressure reside within individual recall, but the ability to recall text became more of a focus.
In essence, the Renaissance made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands in locomotion or bearing weight or swinging through the trees.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the hand's use for bearing weight in knuckle walking.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanges.
Fossil hand bones two million to three million years old reveal this shift in specialization of the hand from locomotion to manipulation.
Some people believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams often enough can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of the lucid dreams expanding the length of time between REM states.
With fewer REMs per night, this state in which you experience actual sleep and your body recovers becomes infrequent enough to become a problem.
This is just as exhausting as if you were to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect is dependent on how often your brain attempts to lucidly dream per night.
Things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start. Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussars had seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief, General Lastucci.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and apparent heir to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.
The modern sport of fencing is played at many levels, from students learning at a university to professional and Olympic competition.
The sport is primarily played in a duel format, one fencer dueling another.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls into holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, with players usually starting on the first hole on the course and finishing on the eighteenth.
The player who takes the fewest strokes, or swings of the club, to complete the course wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is mown shorter and called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with traveling: Recreation tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their regular day-to-day life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and camp grounds are often the most common places frequented by recreational tourists.
If the objective of one’s visit to a particular place is to get to know its history and culture then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different landmarks of a particular country or they may simply opt to focus on just one area.
The Colonists, seeing this activity, had also called for reinforcements.
Troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 men, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men took positions along the fence on the north end of the Colonist's position.
When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north ending at the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it.
The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown, in order to block off any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent any enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, in order to launch a pre-dawn attack.
With the change from the quarter to the half mile run, speed becomes of much less importance and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course a first-class half-miler, a man who can beat two minutes, must be possessed of a fair amount of speed, but endurance must be cultivated at all hazards.
Some cross country running during the winter, combined with gymnasium work for the upper part of the body, is the best preparation for the running season.
Proper nutritional practices alone cannot generate elite performances, but they can significantly affect young athletes' overall wellness.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation practices can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of the sport.
Middle distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions regarding the few pieces of equipment required to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even when it provides no real benefits.
The atom can be considered to be one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
Its a very complex entity which consists, according to a simplified Bohr model, of a central nucleus orbited by electrons, somewhat similar to planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
To Check the victim, you must first survey the scene to ensure your safety.
You need to notice the victim's position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags.
If you get hurt trying to help, you may only serve to make matters worse.
The study found that depression, fear and catastrophising mediated the relationship between pain and disability in lower back pain sufferers.
Only the effects of catastrophizing, not depression and fear was conditional of regular weekly structured PA sessions.
Those participating in regular activity required more support in terms of negative perception of pain distinguishing the differences of chronic pain and discomfort feel from normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see depends on visual system sensory organs or eyes.
There are many different constructions of eyes, ranging in complexity depending on the requirements of the organism.
The different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wave-lengths and have differing degrees of acuity, also they require different processing to make sense of the input and different numbers to work optimally.
A population is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographic area.
When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular phenotypic trait they are known as monomorphic.
When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are polymorphic.
Army ant colonies march and nest in different phases as well.
In the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed everyday.
Each of these nomadic rampages or marches lasts for approximately 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was first coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of life".
The Nervous System maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through out the body to keep the flow of blood going as well as undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body which helps keep the body safe from any potential threat.
Tornadoes strike a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, rip boards from buildings, and fling cars up into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both nearer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefit there will always be more to gain in the short term by acting selfishly
Hopefully, most people will realise that their long term best option is to work together with others.
Many people dream of the day when humans can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what's out there some belive that aliens or other life may live on another plant.
But, if this ever does happen probably won't happen for a very long time. The stars are so spread out that there are trillions of miles between stars that are "neighbors".
Maybe one day, your great grandchildren will be standing atop an alien world wondering about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made of many cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (though not even all animals do; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals are found all over the earth. They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans, and fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living (things) organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another and not change.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. The compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that is all around us, and affects everything we do, yet is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events passing from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens again and again regularly.
Computers today are used to manipulate pictures and videos.
Sophisticated animations can be constructed on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly being used in television and films.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds together.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham islands these were Maori who migrated away from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori there were a few skirmishes and in the end, the Moriori were wiped out
Individuals who had been involved for several decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while candidly assessing difficulties and even failures.
While listening to individuals share their individual, family, and organizational stories, we gained valuable insight into the past and some of the personalities who influenced for good or ill the culture of the organization.
While understanding one’s history does not assume understanding of culture, it does at least help people gain a sense of where they fall within the history of the organization.
While assessing the successes and becoming aware of failures, individuals and the whole of the participating persons discover more deeply the values, mission, and driving forces of the organization.
In this instance, recalling previous instances of entrepreneurial behavior and resulting successes helped people to be open to new changes and new direction for the local church.
Such success stories lessened the fears of change, while creating positive inclinations toward change in the future.
Convergent thinking patterns are problem solving techniques that unite different ideas or fields to find a solution.
The focus of this mindset is speed, logic and accuracy, also identification of facts, reapplying existing techniques, gathering information.
The most important factor of this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers, namely right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain science or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Humans are by far the most talented species in reading the minds of others.
That means we are able to successfully predict what other humans perceive, intend, believe, know or desire.
Among these abilities, understanding the intention of others is crucial. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you were to see someone breaking a car window, you would probably assume he was trying to steal a stranger’s car.
He would need to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to give off tiny radio signals.
In the year 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and research scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later a patent was granted, which was the world's first patent issued in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first “whole-body” MRI scanner, which he called the ”Indomitable”.
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction to others.
It allows students the ability to work at their own pace and control the pace of instructional information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at all times.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of day and expect reasonably quick responses, rather than waiting until the next face-to-face meeting.
The postmodern approach to learning offers the freedom from absolutes. There is no one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn.Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself and information presenting, learning-based television shows illustrates this point.
So many of us find ourselves watching a television show that informs us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never overhaul a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbour's house.
Thanks to undersea fiber optic cable links to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected with 93% of the population having internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (if staying in a guesthouse or private home) will likely have wifi or an internet connected PC, and all settlements have an internet cafe or some location with public wifi.
As mentioned above, though the word "Eskimo" remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered pejorative by many non-U.S. Arctic peoples, especially in Canada.
While you may hear the word used by Greenlandic Natives, its use should be avoided by foreigners.
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), a Greenlander, in Greenland.
Crime, and ill-will toward foreigners in general, is virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in the towns, there are no "rough areas."
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger the unprepared will face.
If you visit Greenland during cold seasons (considering that the further north you go, the colder it will be), it is essential to bring warm enough clothing.
The very long days in the summer can lead to problems getting sufficient sleep and associated health issues.
During the summer, also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit any diseases, they can be irritating.
While San Francisco's economy is linked to it being a world-class tourist attraction, its economy is diversified.
The largest employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism.
Its frequent portrayal in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known throughout the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and top-notch convention facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the nation for other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.
Traveling to Walt Disney World represents a major pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit involves flying into Orlando International Airport, busing to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney property, and returning home.
There are infinite variations possible, but this remains what most people mean when they talk of "going to Disney World".
Many tickets sold online through auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day park-hopper tickets.
While this is a very common activity, it is prohibited by Disney: the tickets are non-transferable.
Any camping below the rim in Grand Canyon requires a backcountry permit.
Permits are limited to protect the canyon, and become available on the 1st day of the month, four months prior to the start month.
Thus, a backcountry permit for any start date in May becomes available on 1 Jan.
Space for the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground adjacent to Phantom Ranch, generally fill up by the requests received on first date they are opened to reservations.
There are a limited number permits reserved for walk-in requests available on a first come, first served basis.
Entering Southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the region's beauty as well as to get to places off the normal tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning but a 4x4 is highly advised and many locations are only accessible with a high wheel base 4x4.
Keep in mind while planning that although Southern Africa is stable not all neighboring countries are.
Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and are affected by the country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws requiring what emergency items need to be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The town lies immediately next to the falls, and they are the major attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventure seekers and sightseers plenty of opportunities for a longer stay.
In the rainy season (November to March), the water volume will be higher and the Falls will be more dramatic.
You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails winding near the Falls.
On the other hand, it is precisely because the volume of water is so high that your viewing of the actual Falls will be obscured—by all the water!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the scene of Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of the almost intact royal burial of the young king.
Compared to most of the other royal tombs, however, the tomb of Tutankhamun is barely worth visiting, being much smaller and with limited decoration.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage to the mummy done during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but have been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time would be best to spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonle Sap lake make the climb to the hill worthwhile.
A visit to the site can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
The Angkor Pass is needed to enter the temple so do not forget to bring your passport along when heading to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, though most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as Israel's capital.
The ancient city in the Judean Hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.
The city is holy to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.
Due to the religious significance of the city, and in particular the many sites of the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historic, archeological and cultural sites, along with vibrant and crowded shopping centers, cafés, and restaurants.
Ecuador requires that Cuban citizens receive an invitation letter prior to entering Ecuador through international airports or frontier admission points.
This letter must be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and comply with certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to provide an organized migratory flow between both countries.
Cuban citizens who are US green card holders should visit an Ecuadorian Consulate to obtain an exemption to this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates. A round/onward trip ticket is needed to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you're by yourself or with just one friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six for a better per-person rate.
However, this shouldn't really be off your concern, because often tourists are shuffled around to fill the cars.
It seems actually to be more a way of tricking people into believing they have to pay more.
Towering above the north end of Machu Picchu is this steep mountain, often the backdrop to many photos of the ruins.
It looks a bit daunting from below, and it is a steep and difficult ascent, but most reasonably fit persons should be able to make it in about 45 minutes.
Stone steps are laid along most of the path, and in the steeper sections steel cables provide a supporting handrail.
That said, expect to be out of breath, and take care in the steeper portions, especially when wet, as it can become dangerous quickly.
There's a tiny cave near the top that must be passed through, it is quite low and a rather tight squeeze.
Seeing the sites and wildlife of the Galapagos is best done by boat, just as Charles Darwin did it in 1835.
Over 60 cruise ships ply the Galapagos waters - ranging in size from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place well in advance (as the boats are usually full during the high season).
Be sure the agent through whom you book is a Galapagos specialist with a good knowledge of a wide variety of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests and/or constraints are matched with the ship most suitable to them.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuche) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups, that were not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (amid the Napoleonic wars that left Spain without a functioning central government for a couple of years), decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti
Besides white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was first inhabited by the Taínos and Caribes. The Caribes were an Arawakan-speaking people who had arrived around 10,000 BCE.
Within a few short years following the arrival of European explorers, the population of Tainos had significantly been reduced by the Spanish conquerors
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias) between 1492 and 1498 the Spanish conquerors killed around 100,000 Taínos.
Jardín de la Unión. This space was built as the atrium for a 17th-century convent, of which the Templo de San Diego is the sole surviving building.
It now functions as the central plaza, and always has a lot of things going on, day and night.
There are a number of restaurants surrounding the garden, and in the afternoons and evening there free concerts are often given from the central gazebo.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters is home of an old love legend.
For a few pennies some children will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend excursion offering kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants, and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound just off Vancouver, and is easily accessed via scheduled water taxis departing Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who enjoy outdoor activities, a trek up the Sea to Sky corridor is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive but well-known because of the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In the winter, enjoy some of the best skiing in North America, and in the summer try some authentic mountain biking.
Permits must be reserved in advance. You must have a permit to stay overnight at Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station that offers dormitory lodging and hot meals in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos offer only camping with no food service.
It is possible to secure park permits directly from the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The Park Service (MINAE) does not issue park permits more than one month in advance of anticipated arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of US$30, or $10 for one-day passes; details on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island country in free association with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands spread out over 2.2 million km2 of ocean.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes thought of as "Hawaii down under".
Though smaller, it reminds some elderly visitors of Hawaii before statehood without all the large tourist hotels and other development.
The Cook Islands do not have any cities but are composed of 15 different islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In developed countries today, providing deluxe bed and breakfasts has been raised to a sort of art-form.
At the top end, B&Bs obviously compete mainly on two main things: bedding and breakfast.
Accordingly, at the finest such establishments one is apt to find the most luxurious bedding, maybe a handmade quilt or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delights of the region or the host's speciality dish.
The setting might be an historic old building with antique furnishings, manicured grounds and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and heading off on a long road trip has an intrinsic appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limitations.
Setting up a tent on private property or in a town of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, using your car is a great way to take a road trip but seldom in itself a way to "camp".
Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon with seats that lay down.
Some hotels have a heritage from the golden age of steam railways and ocean liners; before the Second World War, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were where the rich and the famous of the day would stay, and often had fine dining and nightlife.
The old fashioned fittings, the lack of the latest amenities, and a certain graceful agedness are also part of their character.
While they are usually privately owned, they sometimes accommodate visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A traveller with piles of money might consider a round the world flight, broken up with stays in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is the organization that connects travelers with locals in the cities they are going to visit.
Joining such a network usually just requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional verification.
A listing of available hosts is then provided either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews by other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but did not have a place to stay.
He emailed students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels cater primarily to young people – a typical guest is in their twenties – but you can often find older travellers there too.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels do allow them in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will be the host city of the Olympic Winter Games in 2022, which will make it the first city to have hosted both the summer and winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the indoor ice events.
Other skiing events will be at the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most of the temples do have an Annual festival starting from November end to Mid of May, which varies according to each temple's annual calendar.
Most of the temple festivals is celebrated as part of temple's anniversary or presiding deity's birthday or any other major event associated with the temple.
Kerala's temple festivals are very interesting to see, with regular procession of decorated elephants, temple orchestra and other festivities.
A World's Fair (commonly called World Exposition, or simply Expo) is large international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries present artistic and educational displays in national pavilions to showcase world issues or their country's culture and history.
International Horticultural Expositions are specialised events which showcase floral displays, botanical gardens and anything else to do with plants.
Although in theory they can take place annually (so long as they are in different countries), in practice they are not.
These events normally last anywhere between three and six months, and are held on sites no smaller than 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. Standard 35 mm film (36 by 24 mm negative) is much the commonest.
It can usually be replenished fairly easily if you run out, and gives resolution roughly comparable to a current DSLR.
Some medium-format film cameras use a 6 by 6 cm format, more precisely a 56 by 56 mm negative.
This gives resolution almost four times that of a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
Wildlife is among the most challenging motifs for a photographer, and needs a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often taken for granted, but like photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, though things like a flock of birds or a tiny creature need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about taking photographs for commercial purposes.
Wild animals might either be shy or aggressive. The environment might be cold, hot, or otherwise hostile.
The world has over 5,000 different languages, including more than twenty with 50 million or more speakers.
Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words, also. This is especially true of addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce intelligibly.
Many entire nations are completely fluent in English, and in even more you can expect a limited knowledge - especially among younger people.
Imagine, if you will, a Mancunian, Bostonian, Jamaican and Sydneysider sitting around a table having dinner at a restaurant in Toronto.
They're regaling each other with stories from their hometowns, told in their distinct accents and local argot.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to get fed. Without cooking opportunities, choices are however limited to ready-made food.
Increasingly supermarkets are getting a more varied section of ready-made food. Some even provide a microwave oven or other means to heat food.
In some countries or types of stores there is at least one on-site restaurant, often a rather informal one with affordable prices.
Make and carry copies of your policy and your insurer's contact details with you.
They need to show the insurer's e-mail address and international phone numbers for advice/authorizations and making claims.
Have another copy in your luggage and online (e-mail to yourself with attachment, or stored in the "cloud").
If traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in its memory or disc (accessible without the internet).
Also give policy/contact copies to traveling companions and relatives or friends back home willing to help.
Moose (also known as elk) aren't inherently aggressive, but will defend themselves if they perceive a threat.
When people don't see moose as potentially dangerous, they may approach too closely and put themselves at risk.
Drink alcoholic drinks with moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and knowing your limit is very important.
Possible long term health events from excessive drinking can include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger is increased when consuming illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain various dangerous impurities including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Eyeglasses can be cheaper in a foreign country, especially in low-income countries where labour costs are lower.
Consider getting an eye exam at home, especially if insurance covers it, and bringing the prescription along to be filed elsewhere.
High-end brand-name frames available in such areas may have two problems; some may be knock-offs, and the real imported ones may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded commodities, and you can probably find many types in your home region.
Nevertheless, there are many distinctive ways of drinking coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning (or: canyoneering) is about going in a bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements from swimming, climbing and jumping--but requires relatively little training or physical shape to get started (compared to rock climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing, for example).
Hiking is an outdoor activity which consists of walking in natural environments, often on hiking trails.
Day hiking involves distances of less than a mile up to longer distances that can be covered in a single day.
For a day hike along an easy trail little preparations are needed, and any moderately fit person can enjoy them.
Families with small children may need more preparations, but a day outdoors is easily possible even with babies and pre-school children.
Internationally, there are nearly 200 running tour organizations. Most of them operate independently.
The Global Running Tours successor, Go Running Tours networks dozens of sightrunning providers on four continents.
With roots in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, it was quickly joined by Running Tours Prague based in Prague and others.
There are many things you have to take into consideration before and when you travel somewhere.
When you travel, expect things not to be like they are "back home". Manners, laws, food, traffic, lodging, standards, language and so on will to some extent differ from where you live.
This is something you always need to keep in mind, to avoid disappointment or perhaps even distaste over local ways to do things.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good option for a journey which extends beyond a traveller's previous experience of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to take on most regular bookings, many agents specialise in particular types of travel, budget ranges or destinations.
It can be better to use an agent who frequently books similar trips to yours.
Take a look at what trips the agent is promoting, whether on a website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world on the cheap, for necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are some ways to do that.
Basically, they fall into two categories: Either work while you travel or try and limit your expenses. This article is focused on the latter.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to push expenses down close to zero, see minimum budget travel.
The advice assumes that travellers do not steal, trespass, participate in the illegal market, beg, or otherwise exploit other people for their own gain.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop when disembarking from a plane, a ship, or another vehicle.
In some cross-border trains inspections are done on the running train and you should have valid ID with you when boarding one of those trains.
On night sleeper trains, passports may be collected by the conductor so that you do not have your sleep interrupted.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and address where you are staying with the local authorities.
This might require filling out a form with the local police or a visit to the immigration offices.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels will handle the registration (make sure to ask).
In other cases, only those staying outside of tourist accommodations need to register.  However, this makes the law much more obscure, so find out beforehand.
Architecture is concerned with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in its own right.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or from a cleverly-positioned window can be a beauty to behold.
Architecture overlaps considerably with other fields including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given how remote many of the pueblos are, you won't be able to find a significant amount of nightlife without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, nearly all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several of them bring in name-brand entertainment (primarily the large ones immediately surrounding Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: small-town bars here are not always good places for the out-of-state visitor to hang out.
For one thing, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of intoxicated drivers is high close to small-town bars.
Unwanted murals or scribble is known as graffiti.
While it's far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth vandalizing public and private property using spray paint.
However, nowadays there are established graffiti artists, graffiti events and "legal" walls. Graffiti paintings in this context often resemble artworks rather than illegible tags.
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire.
If you want to learn throwing a boomerang that comes back to your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang for returning.
Most boomerangs available in Australia are in fact non-returning. It is best for beginners to not try throwing in windy
A Hangi Meal is cooked in a hot pit in the ground.
The pit is either heated with hot stones from a fire, or in some places geothermal heat makes areas of ground naturally hot.
The hangi is often used to cook a traditional roast style dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be sampled in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded but slightly more expensive, though still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
Every train has both MetroPlus and Metro coaches; the MetroPlus coaches are always on the end of the train nearest Cape Town.
Carrying for others - Never let your bags out of your sight, especially when you are crossing international borders.
You could find yourself being used as a drug carrier without your knowledge, which will land you in a great deal of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug-sniffing dogs could be used at any time without notice.
Some countries have exceedingly draconian punishments even for first time offenses; these can include prison sentences of over 10 years or death.
Unattended bags are a target for theft and can also attract attention from authorities wary of bomb threats.
At home, due to this constant exposure to the local germs, odds are very high that you're already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna are new to you, you're far more likely to run into problems.
Also, in warmer climates bacteria both grow more quickly and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the scourges of Delhi Belly, the Pharaoh's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge, and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in hot climates are fairly common and in most cases are distinctly annoying but not really dangerous.
If traveling in a developing country for the first time – or in a new part of the world – don't underestimate the potential culture shock.
Many a stable, capable traveler has been overcome by the newness of developing world travel, where many little cultural adjustments can add up quickly.
Especially in your initial days, consider splurging on Western-style and -quality hotels, food, and services to help acclimatize.
Do not sleep on a mattress or pad on the ground in areas where you do not know the local fauna.
If you are going to camp out, bring a camp cot or hammock to keep you away from snakes, scorpions and such.
Fill your home with a rich coffee in the morning and some relaxing chamomile tea at night.
When you're on a staycation, you have the time to treat yourself and take a few extra minutes to brew up something special.
If you're feeling more adventurous, take the opportunity to juice or blend up some smoothies:
maybe you'll discover a simple beverage that you can make for breakfast when you're back to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't frequent.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have distinct meanings.
An infectious disease is one that is caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacterium, fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a disease which is easily transmitted by being in the vicinity of an infected person.
Many governments require visitors entering, or residents leaving, their countries to be vaccinated for a range of diseases.
These requirements may often depend on what countries a traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of strong points of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it has an abundance of high-quality options for families.
Residents from other areas often cite family-friendliness as a primary reason for moving there, and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children around.
In the past 20 years, the amount of child-friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are not generally used by families in Charlotte, though they can be of some use in certain circumstances.
There is a surcharge for having more than 2 passengers, so this option might be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are costly, demand physical fitness, can only take place in summer Nov-Feb, and are largely limited to the Peninsula, Islands and Ross Sea.
A couple of thousand staff live here in summer in some four dozen bases mostly in those areas; a small number stay over winter.
Inland Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered by 2-3 km of ice.
Occasional specialist air tours go inland, for mountaineering or to reach the Pole, which has a large base.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1600 km trail from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It's compacted snow with crevasses filled in and marked by flags. It can only be traveled by specialized tractors, hauling sleds with fuel and supplies.
These aren't very nimble so the trail has to take a long swerve around the Transantarctic Mountains to come onto the plateau.
The most common cause for accidents in winter is slippery roads, pavements (sidewalks) and especially steps.
At a minimum, you need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are deficient.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough in cold temperatures.
Some boots have studs and there is studded add-on equipment for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for the heels or heels and sole.
Heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often scattered on roads or paths to improve traction.
Avalanches are not an abnormality; steep slopes can hold only so much slow, and the excess volumes will come down as avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so it needs some triggering to come down, and some snow coming down can be the triggering event for the rest.
Sometimes the original trigging event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
A tornado is a spinning column of very low-pressure air, which sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.
They generate high winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become "tornadoes" when they touch the ground.
Personal VPN (virtual private network) providers are an excellent way of circumventing both political censorship and commercial IP-geofiltering.
They are superior to web proxies for several reasons: They re-route all Internet traffic, not only http.
They normally offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and thus harder to spy on.
The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this, claiming that it is to "prevent piracy".
In fact, region codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; a bit-for-bit copy of a disk will play just fine on any device where the original will.
The actual purpose is to give those companies more control over their markets; it's all about money spinning.
Because calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use a phone company located where you live or where you travel.
There is also no requirement that you obtain a local number from the community in which you live; you can obtain a satellite Internet connection in the wilds of Chicken, Alaska and select a number which claims you're in sunny Arizona.
Often, you have to buy a global number separately that allows PSTN phones to call you. Where the number is from makes a difference for people calling you.
Real-time text translator apps – applications that are capable of automatically translating whole segments of text from one language into another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points the smartphone towards those objects.
The translation engines have improved dramatically, and now often give more or less correct translations (and more seldom gibberish), but some care is due, as they still may have gotten it all wrong.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the desired language data.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when out of your home country.
It can save money over buying new maps for a GPS, or a standalone GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If you don't have a data connection for your phone, or when it is out of range, their performance can be limited or unavailable.
Every corner store is filled with a confusing array of pre-paid phone cards that can be used from pay phones or ordinary telephones.
While most cards are good for calling anywhere, some specialise in providing favourable call rates to specific groups of countries.
Access to these services is often through a toll-free telephone number that can be called from most phones without charge.
Rules regarding regular photography also apply to video recording, possibly even more so.
If just taking a photo of something isn't allowed, then you shouldn't even think of recording a video of it.
If using a drone, check well in advance as to what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licensing are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Nowadays air travel is only rarely booked directly through the airline without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the same flight can have vastly differing prices at various agregators and it pays to compare search results and to also look at the website of the airline itself before booking.
While you may not need a visa for short visits to certain countries as a tourist or for business, going there as an international student generally requires a longer stay than going there just as a casual tourist.
In general, staying in any foreign country for an extended period of time will require you to obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures from normal tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you will need an offer letter from the institution you wish to study at, and also evidence of funds to support yourself for at least the first year of your course.
Check with the institution, as well as the immigration department for the country you wish to study in for detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, working overseas generally means that you will have to file income tax in the country you are based in.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and the tax rates and brackets vary widely from one country to another.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied both at the federal level and at the local level, so the rates and brackets can vary from region to region.
While immigration check is usually absent or a formality when you arrive in your homeland, customs control can be a hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot bring in and declare anything over the legal limits.
The easiest way to get started in the business of travel writing is to hone your skills on an established travel blog website.
After you become comfortable with formatting and editing on the web, then later, you might create your own website.
Volunteering while travelling is a great way to make a difference but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow a longer stay somewhere since many volunteer jobs provide room and board and a few pay a small salary.
Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check possible need for special permits, which may be difficult to get.
The White Sea–Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mostly by rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to Volga, so coming from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
Be assured that once you hit the marinas everything will be pretty obvious. You will meet other boat hitchhikers and they will share their information with you.
Basically you'll be putting up notices offering your help, pacing the docks, approaching people cleaning their yachts, trying to make contact with sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while everyone will know you and will give you hints as to which boat is looking for someone.
You should choose your Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance carefully.
Although you may think it is intuitive to join the airline you fly most, you should be aware that privileges offered are often different and frequent flyer points may be more generous under a different airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways & Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their services to Africa, and offer connections to many major African cities at competitive rates than other European airlines.
Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries as of 2014.
If you have additional travel time, check to see how your total fare quote to Africa compares with a round-the-world fare.
Don't forget to add in the extra costs of additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.
If you want to fly around the world completely in the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam covers none of the crossings).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged war against the Azeris.
With Armenian backing, a new republic was created. However, no established nation - not even Armenia - officially recognizes it.
Diplomatic arguments over the region continue to mar relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district surrounding the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.
The whole district is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest of the country.
Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands, comprises the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that overlook the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of visible corporate development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages, and cars cannot reach them from the outside.
The varieties of French which are spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, though they are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.
In particular, the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some slight peculiarities that are different from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned standard French in school, so they would be able to understand you even if you used the standard French numbering system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture, indicating "hello."
However, in Malaysia, at least among the Malays in rural areas, it means "come over," similar to the index finger bent toward the body, a gesture which is used in certain Western countries, and should be used only for that purpose.
Similarly, a British traveller in Spain may mistake a wave goodbye involving the palm facing the waver (rather than the person being waved at) as a gesture to come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the intent of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are separate from lingua francas, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for one reason or another as means of communication between speakers of other languages.
In the heat of the day, travelers can experience mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler pursue the mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest of deserts can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothing.
In summer, especially, you'll need to watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to hike through the rainforest.
Even if you're driving through the subtropical rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open while you get inside the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to get in the vehicle with you.
Bird flu, or more formally avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have ever been reported in humans, but some of them have been fatal.
Most have involved people who work with poultry, but there is also some risk to birdwatchers.
Typical for Norway are steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high, more or less even plateau.
These plateaus are often referred to as "vidde" meaning a wide, open treeless space, a boundless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually called "hei" meaning a treeless moorland often covered in heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountain. This will cause cracks, crevasses, which may be obscured by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and cracks can get closed.
At the edge of glaciers huge blocks break loose, fall down and perhaps jump or roll farther from the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations generally peaks during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm during winter, with many hill stations receiving healthy amounts of snow and offering activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer bereavement fares, which slightly discount the cost of last-minute funeral travel.
Airlines that offer these include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights originating from the U.S. or Canada, and WestJet.
In all cases, you must book by phone directly with the airline.
"We now have 4-month-old mice that are non-diabetic that used to be diabetic," he added.
Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia and chair of the clinical and scientific division of the Canadian Diabetes Association cautioned that the research is still in its early days.
Like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured, noting that these findings have no relevance to people who already have Type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy, publicly announced during a radio program on Sveriges Radio in Sweden the committee, unable to reach Bob Dylan directly about winning the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, had abandoned its efforts to reach him.
Danius said, "Right now we are doing nothing. I have called and sent emails to his closest collaborator and received very friendly replies. For now, that is certainly enough."
Previously, Ring's CEO, Jamie Siminoff, remarked the company started when his doorbell wasn't audible from his shop in his garage.
He built a WiFi door bell, he said.
Siminoff said sales boosted after his 2013 appearance in a Shark Tank episode where the show panel declined funding the startup.
In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on shopping television channel QVC.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with competing security company, the ADT Corporation.
While one experimental vaccine appears able to reduce Ebola mortality, up until now, no drugs have been clearly demonstrated suitable for treating existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated it had less benefit than sought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, may be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that may shine light on how abuse of the proportion described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal — making the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to follow their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment.
Throughout 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and then the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
During the 1976 selections he advised Carter on foreign policy, then served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.
As NSA, he assisted Carter in diplomatically handling world affairs, such as the Camp David Accords, 1978; normalizing US–China relations thought the late 1970s; the Iranian Revolution, which led to the Iran hostage crisis, 1979; and the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan, 1979.
The movie, featuring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, received nominations in all major categories.
Gosling and Stone received nominations for Best Actor and Actress respectively.
The other nominations include Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film-editing, Original Score, Production Design, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing and Original Screenplay.
Two songs from the movie, Audition (The Fools Who Dream) and City of Stars, received nominations for best original song. Lionsgate studio received 26 nominations — more than any other studio.
Late on Sunday, the United States President Donald Trump, in a statement delivered via the press secretary, announced US troops would be leaving Syria.
The announcement was made after Trump had a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Turkey would also take over guarding captured ISIS fighters which, the statement said, European nations have refused to repatriate.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also grants insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers inferred the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development that these other features.
The feathers' structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick's down.
The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick's down.
A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspect an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant of responsibility for the attack.
They found the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star with respect to magnetic reversals.
During his trip, Iwasaki ran into trouble on many occasions.
He was robbed by pirates, attacked in Tibet by a rabid dog, escaped marriage in Nepal and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard operates on both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
This will allow it to be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has dual radios.
The speeds of 802.11n are substantially faster than that of its predecessors with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600Mbit/s.
Duvall, who is married with two adult children, did not leave a big impression on Miller, to whom the story was related.
When asked for comment, Miller said, "Mike talks a lot during the hearing...I was getting ready so I wasn't really hearing what he was saying."
"We will endeavour to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a notable margin by 2020 from the 2005 level," Hu said.
He did not set a figure for the cuts, saying they will be made based on China's economic output.
Hu encouraged developing countries "to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later."
He added that "they should not, however, be asked to take on obligations that go beyond their development stage, responsibility and capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12.00 GMT today.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very highly troubling and alarming because of the very high fatality rate."
Some patients might have contracted the bug in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were hospital health workers.

Their thermal behavior is not as steady as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate of choice into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French electoral law rather strictly codifies the proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the new species evolved in just two generations, though this process had been believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold may be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire, which can be twisted and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and stuck onto other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that had their electrons stripped off them (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Swirl the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket over a 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is given us much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
Under them are more medium sized cats that eat medium sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job each cat holds that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances and pull with five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of snarly, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are far smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing for where they've been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) gets separated from the main population that they came from (like if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't easily move back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they had needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen which humans breathe, and they take in carbon-dioxide which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most foods that we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as T. rex would be no match for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals couldn't have included foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For instance, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be a part of the temples.
The top of the tower was special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened in the open air.
Women did the cooking in the yard; stores were just open counters looking into the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled sparsely. In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when travelling further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Though each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you may think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had freed the north of France, but the south still wasn't free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work co-operatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that also somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture implies the passing on of knowledge across several generations, a lingering cultural footprint and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often vanish without leaving relevant historic evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, along with German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japans holds nearly 7,000 islands (the biggest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to, on a geographical stance, as an "archipelago"
Taiwan beginning start way back in 15th century where European sailors passing by record the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624,Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces take control of Taiwan’s western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consist of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues till today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline creating dynamism while keeping a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had bound European states together despite differences in language and customs. I
Its all-pervading power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this tenet was being met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch taking place for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods fierce warfare took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient China’s history thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi’an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief the country belongs to the people not to one sole ruler.
Also after the Revolution occupations were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
Same goes for the military because instead of army rankings being based on class they were now based on cailaber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people of other country's to began their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as “Hira‘” on the Mountain of “Noor” (light) for contemplation.
he cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Resting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen other than the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow mark" like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually generates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on the 6th October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob of people forced the King And Queen to have their carriage windows wide open.
At one point a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war expenditures of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to defray a major part of the expenditures and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The age where the events took place is commonly referred as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography molded individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the manner that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renown for being an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted up until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that Crusaders had returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were valued more than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 year.
towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own style. one of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the crusades people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet just the needs of the agriculturalist and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seed native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or wilful abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are alleged to have been brought up by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When completely brought up by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the particular care-animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals whom are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are internalized in the software and are meant to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been to challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons that range from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We perceive the Foster Care System to be a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they were previously taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” were also identified as new motivation aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements which last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is hard for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but they provide high-quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in somewhat the same way that chimps on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates oppositely to the amount of tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but were extended by the mahayana path of love and by a lot of techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the USSR and USA. With the end of the war the clashes of system, process and culture led to the countries falling out.
With two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet's Union Red Army entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated roughly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although wagonways merely consisted of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.
Crossties were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a stip of iron on the top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron rails were introduced.
The first known transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk upright as habitually.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly to the environment, we can join to the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce the future suffering in some degree.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should deactivate them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed much because of humankind's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Through the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information which is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient familiarity with Bed-bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in nest or housing of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the leading neurological disease in younger and middle aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research has found that females are two times more likely to have MS then males.
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple may parent the child.
Science’s main goal is to figure out the way the world works through the scientific method. This method in fact guides most scientific research.
It isn’t alone though, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Accepted were Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self sustaining oscillators which will continue a period of free-running cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected with, and supporting, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you seldom hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems engender such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one-hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragon flies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the biggest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second biggest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that pours out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians marvelled at their predecessors monuments, which were then well over a thousand year old.
Vatican City's population is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from antiquity, as these can all be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorised that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to lesser status and uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to come close to a sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Sort of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus up again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to break apart with little or no nudging.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise up to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding what makes people tick or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires which have been internalized as they mature to adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that make them want the things that they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or gals).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary action, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one morphs into an unrecognizable individual that feels he or she must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior oftentimes results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet according to varying time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each of the members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can transpire.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore it narrows the research area and makes it much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI ​​system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been built in several home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a large part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would love to take her students places to which a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect a on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website gets remodeled, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often begin their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Also blogging "forces students to become more savvy about the world around them." The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features an array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some is nearly uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of population that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the biggest, and a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took in a big way in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women travellers say that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is helpful to also wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in what they would consider harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in turning down men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of geegaws, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the town’s streets, particularly the town centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base to climb the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arabic flair than of an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided in 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial for one to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to either selections of parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart that is made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The great majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonisers took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests aren't just mangrove swamps though — they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles which once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, though most, especially those heading to the east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it's 378 meters long and it has two lanes of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be finished.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practised subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards started the colonization period which lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to keep a lot of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The largest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is set equivalent to that of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money prior to leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain stays roughly the same throughout the year.
Though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's straddling of two harbours. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes-crowded family beaches with a good range of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to be had, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are fearful.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino comes heaped high with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are pricey but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made all year around, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, like camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests though should be coursed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of the attendants to music festivals decide to camp on site, and most attendants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you're going to have to get in early to get a camping site close to the music.
Remember that even though music on the main stages may have finished, there may be sections of the festival that will keep playing music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as going through ice causes quite horrible noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in town. Cruise passengers are exempted from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make many efforts to maximize time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers, to keep guests in a good mood, and keep them at the premise.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who's going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roadways, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in very little time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic goes on mostly uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourism draw in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to overland travel to view the stunning African wildlife, particularly on savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach closely to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies don't extend to July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It's expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if one is not present in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't fancy wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow fabric to become too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorch).
There are different ways of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is enough, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and should you have a concern, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempted from taxes and excises at certain locations.
Travellers bound for countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, passing frequently through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections — commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strict obedience to them is even more important than otherwise.
Curiously, though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked into pastries year round, and cherries and plums making their appearances during the summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small though rich pastries, try what depending on region are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a vast variety of regional cuisines found across the nation.
But, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features an array of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavorings the Javanese favor being peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the potential for a rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow, sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite big walls and crags.
Summits include breath-taking views from peaks. Climbers from all parts of the world are continually establishing new routes amongst its endless potential of walls.
Downhill snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travelling activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," planning entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old — cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually not involving alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter ones done in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as of a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than walking – but only very seldom you will get the speeds of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack in groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen zone, however, works somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each of the Schengen member countries separately, hence saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products might be defined as antiques, though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding the trade is important also for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, though, not all Sámi have been involved in big scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar, having reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Though it is widely used, especially among non-Romani, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you will be visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations from Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are merely a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often cursory, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should get professional training.
A search of the Internet for 'Hostile environment course' will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in far greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally be from 2-5 days and will involve role play, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Voyagers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they're carrying valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with gender not stated (X) or documents updated to match a desired name and gender varies.
Willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is just as widely variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves breaking off the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated at a few deeper sections, and a fast current to deep water may form there.
Most deaths happen as result of fatigue trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normally.
Try aiming somewhere where you are not caught again or, depending on your skills and on whether you have been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes on sooner than culture shock (there's less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly hard time readjusting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you've adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad at first, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for kids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always here the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light is just like a story book.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit up.
South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, peaking at 4892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions who have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly more popular option for those planning a gap-year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling on a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great boating destination. The "Land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands too, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the biggest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat to every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most of the distinct Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using shipboard excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above Berlin is no where near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they've not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that very many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight may help to overcome a fear which is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Frequently, time is very important with business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller firms there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way of flying in first or business class is to fork out a thick wad of money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as rough rules of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and in comfort, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.
The major religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second biggest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offer views of the nearby island Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable meaning to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all of the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
While this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris still is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well brought up). It will make getting about considerably easier.
Parisians' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes national park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a notably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, differing soils and varying levels of altitude.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering the knees and have their shoulders covered, too.
Most of the monasteries do provide wraps for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men are required to wear trousers covering the knees.
This too can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but that clothing isn't washed after every user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar zones in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (specially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available condiments such as cheese, tunafish, etc.
All nouns, alongside the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also arguably makes reading easier, though writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian since most words are pronounced exactly how they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, since their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, whereas carro means chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer would help you learn much about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it need not be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today, and remain as museums, or sites of education.
As light pollution in their heyday was not the kind of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or at campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" is also going to get you ejected, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arriving.
But being placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of equator you will need to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are thinking of taking goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

There's a tradition to pass the Easter night awake at some exposed point to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the congregations often breaking into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived in the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent mammals were unable to make the journey making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
As the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal that what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and coworkers call each other by their family names or by job titles.
Workplace harmony is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual accomplishments.
